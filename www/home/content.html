<p>HAP is a homological
algebra library for use with the
GAP computer algebra system, and is still under development. Its
initial focus is on computations related to the cohomology of groups.
Both finite and infinite groups are handled, with emphasis on
integral coefficients. </p>

<p>Recent additions include some functions for computing homology of crossed modules and simplicial groups, and also some functions for handling simplicial complexes, cubical complexes and regular CW-complexes in the context of topological data analysis. </p>

<p>The current version 1.10.1 was released on 12 
May 2012.</p>

<p>An overview  of the library can be found <a
