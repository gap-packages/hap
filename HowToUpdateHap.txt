rm hap/HowToUpdateHap.txt    THIS SEEMS TO BE IMPORTANT

diff -r pkg/Hap1.30/ hap/

cd hap and then

 git add .
 git commit -m "message"
 git push origin master  [with username grahamknockillaree and passwd MumWon]

 git clone --branch gh-pages  https://github.com/gap-packages/hap.git
 
Rename the gh-pages directory from whatever it is called to gh-pages

Populate gh-pages/doc  gh-pages/tutorial  gh-pages/www with most recent files (xml, html files, etc.)

Make sure you have the latest Release Tools and then from within hap type

../ReleaseTools/release-gap-package --token ghp_whateverthetokenis

For some reason it may be necessary to perform the last command as root.

Then manually push the tutorial pages to the gh-branch on github.

That's it.
