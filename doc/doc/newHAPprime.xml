<Description>

<P/>

 When applied to a finite <M>2</M>-group <M>G</M> this function returns a presentation for the mod 2 cohomology ring <M>H^*(G,Z_2)</M>. The Lyndon-Hochschild-Serre spectral sequence is used to prove that the presentation is correct.

<P/>
When the function is applied to a <M>2</M>-group <M>G</M> and positive integer <M>n</M> the function first constructs <M>n</M> terms of a free <M>Z_2G</M>-resolution <M>R</M>, then constructs the finite-dimensional graded algebra
<M>A=H^(*\le n)(G,Z_2)</M>, and finally uses <M>A</M> to approximate
 a presentation for <M>H^*(G,Z_2)</M>. For "sufficiently large" the approximation will be a correct presentation for <M>H^*(G,Z_2)</M>.

<P/> Alternatively, the function can be applied directly to either the resolution <M>R</M> or graded algebra <M>A</M>.

<P/>This function was written by <B>Paul Smith</B>. It uses the Singular commutative algebra package to handle the Lyndon-Hochschild-Serre spectral sequence.
