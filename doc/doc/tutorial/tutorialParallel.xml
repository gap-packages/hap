<P/>The following example creates five child processes and uses them simultaneously to compute
the second integral homology of each of the <M>267</M>
groups of order <M>64</M>. The final command shows that
<P/><M>H_2(G,\mathbb Z)=\mathbb Z_2^{15}</M>
<P/>for the <M>267</M>-th group <M>G</M> in <B>GAP</B>'s library of small groups.

<P/>The function <C>ParallelList()</C> is built from <B>HAP</B>'s
six core functions for parallel computation.
