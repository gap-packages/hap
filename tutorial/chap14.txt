  [33X[0;0YThe  [13XBianchi  groups[113X are the groups [22XG_-d=PSL_2(cal O_-d)[122X where [22Xd[122X is a square
  free  positive integer and [22Xcal O_-d[122X is the ring of integers of the imaginary
  quadratic field [22XQ(sqrt-d)[122X. These groups act on [13Xupper-half space[113X[133X

  [33X[0;0YWe  take  the  boundary  [22Xâˆ‚  frak  h^3[122X to be the Riemann sphere [22XC âˆª âˆž[122X and let
  [22Xoverlinefrak  h^3[122X  denote the union of [22Xfrak h^3[122X and its boundary. The action
  of  [22XG_-d[122X  extends  to  the  boundary.  The element [22Xâˆž[122X and each element of the
  number  field  [22XQ(sqrt-d)[122X  are thought of as lying in the boundary [22Xâˆ‚ frak h^3[122X
  and  are  referred  to as [13Xcusps[113X. Let [22XX[122X denote the union of [22Xfrak h^3[122X with the
  set  of cusps, [22XX=frak h^3 âˆª {âˆž} âˆª Q(sqrt-d)[122X. It follows from work of Bianchi
  and  Humbert  that  the space [22XX[122X admits the structure of a regular CW-complex
  (depending  on  [22Xd[122X)  for  which  the  action of [22XG_-d[122X on [22Xfrak h^3[122X extends to a
  cellular  action on [22XX[122X which permutes cells. Moreover, [22XG_-d[122X acts transitively
  on  the [22X3[122X-cells of [22XX[122X and each [22X3[122X-cell has trivial stabilizer in [22XG_-d[122X. Details
  are provided in Richard Swan's paper [Swa71b].[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YWe  refer  to  the closure in [22XX[122X of any one of these [22X3[122X-cells as a [13Xfundamental
  domain[113X  for  the  action  [22XG_-d[122X.  Cohomology  of  [22XG_-d[122X can be computed from a
  knowledge of the combinatorial structure of this fundamental domain together
  with a knowledge of the stabilizer groups of the cells of dimension [22Xâ‰¤ 2[122X.[133X

  point  [22Xb/a  âˆˆ C[122X and of radius [22X|a|[122X. The radius is [22Xâ‰¤ 1[122X. Think of the points in
  [22Xfrak  h^3[122X  as  lying  strictly  above  [22XC[122X. Let [22XB[122X denote the space obtained by

  [33X[0;0YExplicit  fundamental  domains  for  certain  values of [22Xd[122X were calculated by
  Bianchi  in  the  1890s  and  further calculations were made by Swan in 1971
  [Swa71b].   In   the   1970s,   building   on   Swan's  work,  Robert  Riley
  ([7Xhttps://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0723086913000042[107X)
  developed  a  computer  program for computing fundamental domains of certain
  Kleinian  groups  (including  Bianchi  groups).  In  their  2010  PhD theses
  Alexander Rahm ([7Xhttps://theses.hal.science/tel-00526976/en/[107X) and M.T. Aranes
  ([7Xhttps://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/id/eprint/35128/[107X)     independently    developed
  Pari/GP  and  Sage  software  based  on  Swan's  ideas.  In  2011 Dan Yasaki
  ([7Xhttps://mathstats.uncg.edu/sites/yasaki/publications/bianchipolytope.pdf[107X)
  used  a different approach based on Voronoi's theory of perfect forms in his
  Magma  software  for  fundamental  domains  of  Bianchi  groups.  Aurel Page
  ([7Xhttp://www.normalesup.org/~page/Recherche/Logiciels/logiciels-en.html[107X)
  developed  software  for  fundamental domains of Kleinian groups in his 2010
  masters       thesis.       In       2018       Sebastian      Schoennenbeck
  ([7Xhttps://github.com/schoennenbeck/VMH-DivisionAlgebras[107X)  used a more general
  approach  based  on  perfect  forms  in  his  Magma  software  for computing
  fundamental  domains  of  Bianchi  and other groups. Output from the code of
  Alexander  Rahm  and  Sebastian Schoennenbeck for certain Bianchi groups has
  been stored iin [12XHAP[112X for use in constructing free resolutions.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YMore  recently a [12XGAP[112X implementation of Swan's algorithm has been included in
  [12XHAP[112X.  The  implementation  uses  exact  computations  in  [22XQ(sqrt-d)[122X  and  in
  [22XQ(sqrtd)[122X.  A  bespoke  implementation  of  these  two  fields is part of the
  implementation  so  as  to  avoid making apparently slower computations with
  cyclotomic  numbers.  The  account  of  Swan's  algorithm  in  the thesis of
  Alexander Rahm was the main reference during the implementation.[133X

  [22X2[122X-cells  can  be viewed as a [22X2[122X-dimensional image by projecting them onto the
