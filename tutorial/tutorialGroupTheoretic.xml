the number of quandle homomorphisms from these two finitely prresented quandles to the <M>17</M>-th quandle in <B>HAP</B>'s library of connected quandles of order <M>24</M>.

	Free resolutons for a group <M>G</M> are constructed in <B>HAP</B> 
		as the cellular chain complex <M>R_\ast=C_\ast(\tilde X)</M> of the universal cover of some 
			CW-complex <M>X=K(G,1)</M>. The <M>2</M>-skeleton of
			<M>X</M> gives rise to a free presentation for the group <M>G</M>. 
				This presentation depends on a choice of maximal tree in the <M>1</M>-skeleton of <M>X</M> in cases where <M>X</M> has more than one <M>0</M>-cell. The attaching maps of 
				<M>3</M>-cells in <M>X</M> can be regarded as 
				<E>homotopical syzygies</E> or van Kampen diagrams over the group presentation whose boundaries spell the trivial word. 

				<P/>The following example constructs four terms of

					from the resolution as well as the unique homotopical syzygy. The syzygy is visualized in terms of its graph of edges, 
					directed edges being coloured according to the corresponding

	<P/>The homotopical syzygy is special since in this example the edge directions and labels can be understood as specifying three homeomorphisms
		between pairs of faces. Viewing the syzygy as the boundary of the <M>3</M>-ball, by using the homeomorphisms to identify the faces in each face pair we obtain a quotient CW-complex <M>M</M>
			involving one vertex, three edges, three <M>2</M>-cells and one <M>3</M>-cell. The cell structure on the quotient exists because,

		<P/>
			Based on the definitions and examples in Section <Ref Sect="secExtensions"/> the additional data type of a cc-group

<P/>The first example in Section <Ref Sect="secExtensions"/> illustrates the construction of cc-groups for which both the base <M>G</M> and fibre <M>N</M> are finite pc-groups. That example extends to any scenario in which the base <M>G</M> is a group for which:
<Enum>
<Item>we can construct the first 3 degrees of a free <M>\mathbb ZG</M>-resolution <M>C_\ast X</M>.</Item>

<P/> As an illustration where the base group is a non-solvable finite group and the fibre is the infinite cyclic group, with  base group acting trivially on the fibre, the following commands list up to Yoneda equivalence
	all central extensions 
<M>\mathbb Z \rightarrowtail E \twoheadrightarrow G</M> for <M>G=A_5:C_{16}</M>.
	The base group is a non-solvable semi-direct product of  order <M>960</M> and thus none of the <M>16</M> extensions are polycyclic. The commands 
		classify the extensions according to their integral homology in degrees <M> \le 2</M>, showing that there are precisely 5 such equivalence classes of extensions. Thus, there are at least 5 distinct isomorphism types among the <M>16</M> extensions. 
			A presentation is constructed for the group corresponding to the sixteenth extension. The final command lists the orders of the 16 cohomology group elements corresponding to the 16 extensions. The 16th element has order 1, meaning that the sixteenth extension is the direct product <M>C_\infty\ \times\ A_5:C_{16}</M>.
