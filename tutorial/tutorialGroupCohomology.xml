<P/>It is possible to compute the low degree (co)homology of a
 finite group or monoid 
of small order directly from the bar resolution. 
The following commands take this approach to computing the fifth integral
homology 
<P/><M>H_5(Q_4,\mathbb Z) = \mathbb Z_2\oplus\mathbb Z_2</M>
<P/>of the quaternion group <M>G=Q_4</M> of order <M>8</M>.

<P/>However, this approach is of limited applicability since the bar resolution involves  <M>|G|^k</M> free generators in degree <M>k</M>. A range of techniques, tailored to specific classes of groups, can be used to compute the (co)homology of larger finite groups.

One method of producting a Lie algebra <M>L</M> from a group 
		<M>G</M>
is by forming
			the direct sum <M>L(G) = G/\gamma_2G \oplus \gamma_2G/\gamma_3G \oplus \gamma_3G/\gamma_4G \oplus \cdots</M> of the quotients of the lower central series <M>\gamma_1G=G</M>, <M>\gamma_{n+1}G=[\gamma_nG,G]</M>. 
				Commutation in <M>G</M> induces a Lie bracket <M>L(G)\times L(G) \rightarrow L(G)</M>.

			<P/>
				The homology <M>H_n(L)</M>
					of a Lie algebra (with trivial coefficients) 
					can be calculated as the homology of the  Chevalley-Eilenberg chain complex <M>C_\ast(L)</M>. 
						This chain complex is implemented in <B>HAP</B> in the cases where the underlying additive group of <M>L</M> is either 
							finitely generated torsion free or  finitely generated of prime exponent <M>p</M>. In these two cases the ground ring for the Lie algebra/ Chevalley-Eilenberg complex
								is taken to be <M>\mathbb Z</M> and <M>\mathbb Z_p</M> respectively.

						<P/> For example, consider the quotient <M>G=F/\gamma_8F</M> of the free group
						<M>F=F(x,y)</M> on two generators by eighth term of its lower central series. So <M>G</M> is the <E>free nilpotent group of class 7 on two generators</E>.
							The following commands compute <M>H_4(L(G)) =  \mathbb Z_2^{77} \oplus \mathbb Z_6^8 \oplus \mathbb Z_{12}^{51} \oplus \mathbb Z_{132}^{11} \oplus \mathbb Z^{2024}</M> and show that the fourth homology in this case contains 2-, 3- and 11-torsion.

	<P/>
        For a free nilpotent group <M>G</M> the additive homology <M>H_n(L(G))</M>
		of the Lie algebra can be computed more quickly in <B>HAP</B>
			than the integral group homology <M>H_n(G,\mathbb Z)</M>. 
				Clearly there are isomorphisms<M>H_1(G) \cong H_1(L(G)) \cong G_{ab}</M> of abelian groups in homological degree <M>n=1</M>. Hopf's formula can be used to establish an isomorphism
				<M>H_2(G) \cong H_2(L(G))</M> also in degree <M>n=2</M>. The following two theorems provide further isomorphisms that allow for the homology of a free nilpotent group to be calculated more efficiently as the homology of the associated Lie algebra.

				<P/><B>Theorem 1.</B> <Cite Key="kuzmin"/> <E>Let <M>G</M>
						be a finitely generated free nilpotent group of class 2. Then the integral 
						group homology <M>H_n(G,\mathbb Z)</M> is isomorphic to the integral 
Lie algebra homology <M>H_n(L(G),\mathbb Z)</M> in each degree <M>n\ge0</M>.</E>

	<P/>
	<B>Theorem 2.</B> <Cite Key="igusa"/> 
<E>Let <M>G</M>
be a finitely generated free nilpotent group (of any class). Then the integral
                                                group homology <M>H_n(G,\mathbb Z)</M> is isomorphic to the integral
Lie algebra homology <M>H_n(L(G),\mathbb Z)</M> in  degrees <M>n=0, 1, 2, 3</M>.</E>

	<P/>We should remark that experimentation on free nilpotent groups of class <M>\ge 4</M> has not yielded a group for which the isomorphism <M>H_n(G,\mathbb Z) \cong H_n(L(G),\mathbb G)</M> fails. For instance, the isomorphism holds in degree <M>n=4</M> for the free nilpotent group of class 5 on two generators, and for the free nilpotent group of class 2 on four generators:

This list of cases 
is taken from the  <URL><Link>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spherical_3-manifold</Link><LinkText>Wikipedia pages</LinkText></URL>. The group <M>\Gamma</M>

It can be shown that <M>G</M> has periodic cohomology of period <M>n</M> if and only if <M>H^{n}(G,\mathbb Z)=\mathbb Z_{|G|}</M>.)

<M>(g_1 | g_2 | \ldots | g_n)</M> of elements <M>g_i</M> in <M>G</M>. In this case we say that the <M>n</M>-cocycle is a <E>standard n-cocycle</E>
 and we think of it as a set-theoretic function
<P/><M>f \colon  G \times G \times \cdots \times   G  \longrightarrow A</M>
<P/>satisfying a certain algebraic cocycle condition. 

Bearing in mind that a standard <M>n</M>-cocycle really just assigns an element <M>f(g_1, \ldots ,g_n) \in A</M> to an <M>n</M>-simplex in the nerve of <M>G</M>
, the cocycle condition is a very natural one which states that 
<E><M>f</M> must vanish on the boundary of a certain <M>(n+1)</M>-simplex</E>. For <M>n=2</M> the condition is that a <M>2</M>-cocycle <M>f(g_1,g_2)</M>
must satisfy 
<P/><M>g.f(h,k) + f(g,hk) = f(gh,k) + f(g,h)</M>
<P/> for all <M>g,h,k \in G</M>. This equation is explained by the following picture.

<P/>
The definition of a cocycle clearly depends on the choice of <M>\mathbb ZG</M>-resolution <M>R_\ast</M>. However, the cohomology group <M>H^n(G,A)</M>, which is a group of equivalence classes of <M>n</M>-cocycles, is independent of the choice of <M>R_\ast</M>. 

<P/>
There are some occasions when one needs explicit examples of standard cocycles. For instance:

<List>
<Item>    Let <M>G</M> be a finite group and <M>k</M>
a field of characteristic <M>0</M>. The group algebra <M>k(G)</M>,
 and the algebra <M>F(G)</M> of functions 
<M>d_g\colon G\rightarrow k, h\rightarrow d_{g,h}</M>,
 are both Hopf algebras. The tensor product <M>F(G) \otimes k(G)</M>
 also admits a Hopf algebra structure known as the quantum double <M>D(G)</M>. 
A twisted quantum double <M>D_f(G)</M> was introduced by 
R. Dijkraaf, V. Pasquier &amp; P. Roche <Cite Key="dpr"/>. 
The twisted double is a quasi-Hopf algebra depending on a <M>3</M>-cocycle 
<M>f\colon G\times G\times G\rightarrow k</M>. The multiplication is given by 
<M>(d_g \otimes x)(d_h \otimes y) = d_{gx,xh}\beta_g(x,y)(d_g \otimes xy)</M> where <M>\beta_a </M>
is defined by <M>\beta_a(h,g) = f(a,h,g) f(h,h^{-1}ah,g)^{-1} f(h,g,(hg)^{-1}ahg)</M> .  Although the algebraic structure of <M>D_f(G)</M> depends very much on the particular <M>3</M>-cocycle <M>f</M>, representation-theoretic properties of <M>D_f(G)</M> depend only on the cohomology class of <M>f</M>.
</Item>
<Item>    An explicit <M>2</M>-cocycle <M>f\colon G\times G\rightarrow A</M> is needed to construct the multiplication <M>(a,g)(a',g') = (a + g\cdot a' + f(g,g'),  gg')</M> in the extension a group <M>G</M> by a <M>\mathbb ZG</M>-module 
<M>A</M> determined by the cohomology class of <M>f</M> in <M>H^2(G,A)</M>.
See <Ref Sect="secExtensions"/>.
</Item>
<Item>    In work on coding theory and Hadamard matrices a number of papers have investigated square matrices <M>(a_{ij})</M> whose entries <M>a_{ij}=f(g_i,g_j)</M>
 are the values of a <M>2</M>-cocycle <M>f\colon G\times G \rightarrow
 \mathbb Z_2</M>
 where <M>G</M> is a finite group acting trivially on <M>\mathbb Z_2</M>. See for instance <Cite Key="horadam"/> and <Ref Sect="secHadamard"/>.

<P/>
Given a <M>\mathbb ZG</M>-resolution <M>R_\ast</M>
 (with contracting homotopy) and a <M>\mathbb ZG</M>-module <M>A</M>
 one can use HAP commands to compute explicit standard <M>n</M>-cocycles 
<M>f\colon G^n \rightarrow A</M>. With the twisted quantum double in mind, we illustrate the computation for <M>n=3</M>, <M>G=S_3</M>, and <M>A=U(1)</M>
 the group of complex numbers of modulus <M>1</M> with trivial <M>G</M>-action.

<P/>
We first compute a <M>\mathbb ZG</M>-resolution <M>R_\ast</M>. The Universal Coefficient Theorem gives an isomorphism <M>H_3(G,U(1)) = Hom_{\mathbb Z}(H_3(G,\mathbb Z), U(1))</M>, The multiplicative group <M>U(1)</M> can thus be viewed as 
<M>\mathbb Z_m</M> where <M>m</M> is a multiple of the exponent of <M>H_3(G,\mathbb Z)</M>.

<Example>

</Example>

<P/>
We thus replace the very infinite group U(1) by the finite cyclic group <M>\mathbb Z_6</M>. Since the resolution <M>R_\ast </M> has <M>4</M> generators in degree <M>3</M>, a homomorphism <M>f\colon R^3\rightarrow U(1)</M> can 
be represented by a list <M>f=[f_1, f_2, f_3, f_4]</M> with <M>f_i</M>
  the image in <M>\mathbb Z_6</M> of the <M>i</M>th generator. The cocycle condition on <M>f</M> can be expressed as a matrix equation

<P/><M>Mf^t = 0  \bmod 6</M>.

<P/>
where the matrix <M>M</M> is obtained from the following command and <M>f^t</M> denotes the transpose.
<Example>
<#Include SYSTEM "tutex/6.21.txt">

A particular cocycle <M>f=[f_1, f_2, f_3, f_4]</M> can be obtained by choosing a solution to the equation Mf^t=0.

A non-standard <M>3</M>-cocycle <M>f</M> can be converted to a standard one using the command  <Code>StandardCocycle(R,f,n,q)</Code> . This command inputs 
<M>  R_\ast</M>, integers <M>n</M> and <M>q</M>, and an <M>n</M>-cocycle <M>f</M> for the resolution <M>R_\ast</M>. It returns a standard cocycle <M>G^n \rightarrow \mathbb Z_q</M>.

<Example>

A function <M>f\colon G\times G\times G \rightarrow A</M>
 is a standard <M>3</M>-cocycle if and only if

<P/><M>g\cdot f(h,k,l) -  f(gh,k,l) + f(g,hk,l) -  f(g,h,kl) + f(g,h,k) = 0</M>

<P/>for all <M>g,h,k,l \in G</M>. In the above example the group <M>G=S_3</M>
 acts trivially on <M>A=Z_6</M>. The following commands show that the standard 
<M>3</M>-cocycle produced in the example really does satisfy this <M>3</M>-cocycle condition.

Let <M>G</M> be a finite group with order divisible by  prime <M>p</M>. Let
