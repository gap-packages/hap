<P/>It is possible to compute the low degree (co)homology of a
 finite group or monoid 
of small order directly from the bar resolution. 
The following commands take this approach to computing the fifth integral
homology 
<P/><M>H_5(Q_4,\mathbb Z) = \mathbb Z_2\oplus\mathbb Z_2</M>
<P/>of the quaternion group <M>G=Q_4</M> of order <M>8</M>.
<Example>

<P/>However, this approach is of limited applicability since the bar resolution involves  <M>|G|^k</M> free generators in degree <M>k</M>. A range of techniques, tailored to specific classes of groups, can be used to compute the (co)homology of larger finite groups. 


<P/> The following example computes the fourth integral cohomomogy of the Mathieu group <M>M_{24}</M>.

<P/>The preceding calculation could be achieved more quickly by noting that 
<M>W=Weyl(E_8)</M> is a Coxeter group, and by using the associated Coxeter polytope. The following example uses this approach to compute the fourth integral homology of <M>W</M>. It begins by displaying the Coxeter diagram of <M>W</M>,

<Section><Heading>Cohomology with coefficients in a module</Heading>
There are various ways to represent a <M>\mathbb ZG</M>-module <M>A</M>
with action <M>G\times A \rightarrow A, (g,a)\mapsto \alpha(g,a)</M>. 

<P/>One possibility is to use the data type of a <E><M>G</M>-Outer Group</E> which involves three components: an <M>ActedGroup</M> <M>A</M>; an <M>Acting Group</M> <M>G</M>; a <M>Mapping</M> <M>(g,a)\mapsto \alpha(g,a)</M>.
The following example uses this data type to compute the cohomology <M>H^4(G,A) =\mathbb Z_5 \oplus \mathbb Z_{10}</M> of the symmetric group <M>G=S_6</M> with coefficients in the integers <M>A=\mathbb Z</M> where odd permutations act non-trivially on <M>A</M>.

<Section Label="Secfinitefundman"><Heading>Cohomology rings of finite fundamental groups of 3-manifolds
</Heading>
A <E>spherical 3-manifold</E> is a 3-manifold arising as the quotient <M>S^3/\Gamma</M> of the 3-sphere <M>S^3</M> by a  finite subgroup <M>\Gamma</M> of <M>SO(4)</M> acting freely as rotations.
The geometrization conjecture, proved by Grigori Perelman,
 implies that every closed connected 3-manifold with a finite fundamental group is homeomorphic to a spherical 3-manifold.

<P/> A spherical 3-manifold <M>S^3/\Gamma</M> has finite fundamental group isomorphic to <M>\Gamma</M>. This fundamental group is one of: 
<List>
<Item> <M>\Gamma=C_m=\langle x\ |\ x^m\rangle</M> (<B>cyclic fundamental group</B>)</Item>
<Item> <M>\Gamma=C_m\times  \langle x,y \ |\ xyx^{-1}=y^{-1}, x^{2^k}=y^n
\rangle</M> for  integers <M>k, m\ge 1, n\ge 2</M> and <M>m</M> coprime to <M>2n</M> (<B>prism manifold case</B>)</Item>
<Item> <M>\Gamma= C_m\times \langle x,y, z \ |\ (xy)^2=x^2=y^2, zxz^{-1}=y, zyz^{-1}=xy, z^{3^k}=1\rangle </M> for integers <M>k,m\ge 1</M> and <M>m</M> coprime to 6 (<B>tetrahedral case</B>)</Item>
<Item> <M>\Gamma=C_m\times\langle x,y\ |\ (xy)^2=x^3=y^4\rangle </M> for <M>m\ge 1</M> coprime to 6 (<B>octahedral case</B>)</Item>

This list of cases 
is taken from the  <URL><Link>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spherical_3-manifold</Link><LinkText>Wikipedia pages</LinkText></URL>. The group <M>\Gamma</M>
  has periodic cohomology since it acts on a sphere. The cyclic group has
period 2 and in the other four cases it has  period 4. (Recall that in general a finite group <M>G</M> has <E>periodic cohomology of period <M>n</M></E> if there is an element <M>u\in H^n(G,\mathbb Z)</M> such that the cup product <M>-\ \cup u\colon H^k(G,\mathbb Z) \rightarrow H^{k+n}(G,\mathbb Z)</M> is an isomorphism for all <M>k\ge 1</M>. It can be shown that <M>G</M> has periodic cohomology of period <M>n</M> if and only if <M>H^{n}(G,\mathbb Z)=\mathbb Z_{|G|}</M>.)

<P/>The cohomology of the cyclic group is well-known, and the cohomology of a direct product can be obtained from that of the factors using the Kunneth formula.

<P/> In the icosahedral case with <M>m=1</M> the following commands yield
$$H^\ast(\Gamma,\mathbb Z)=Z[t]/(120t=0)$$
with generator <M>t</M> of degree 4. The final command demonstrates that a periodic resolution is used in the computation.

In the octahedral case with <M>m=1</M> we obtain

where <M>s</M> has degree 2 and  <M>t</M> has degree 4,

<Section><Heading>Explicit cocycles </Heading>

Given a <M>\mathbb ZG</M>-resolution <M>R_\ast</M> and a <M>\mathbb ZG</M>-module 
<M>A</M>, one defines an <E><M>n</M>-cocycle</E> to be a <M>\mathbb ZG</M>-homomorphism 
<M>f\colon R_n \rightarrow A</M> for which the composite homomorphism 
<M>fd_{n+1}\colon R_{n+1}\rightarrow A</M> is zero. If <M>R_\ast</M>
 happens to be the standard bar resolution (i.e. the cellular chain complex of the nerve of the group <M>G</M> considered as a one object category) then the free <M>\mathbb ZG</M>-generators of <M>R_n</M> are indexed by <M>n</M>-tuples 
<M>(g_1 | g_2 | \ldots | g_n)</M> of elements <M>g_i</M> in <M>G</M>. In this case we say that the <M>n</M>-cocycle is a <E>standard n-cocycle</E>
 and we think of it as a set-theoretic function
<P/><M>f \colon  G \times G \times \cdots \times   G  \longrightarrow A</M>
<P/>satisfying a certain algebraic cocycle condition. 

Bearing in mind that a standard <M>n</M>-cocycle really just assigns an element <M>f(g_1, \ldots ,g_n) \in A</M> to an <M>n</M>-simplex in the nerve of <M>G</M>
, the cocycle condition is a very natural one which states that 
<E><M>f</M> must vanish on the boundary of a certain <M>(n+1)</M>-simplex</E>. For <M>n=2</M> the condition is that a <M>2</M>-cocycle <M>f(g_1,g_2)</M>
must satisfy 
<P/><M>g.f(h,k) + f(g,hk) = f(gh,k) + f(g,h)</M>
<P/> for all <M>g,h,k \in G</M>. This equation is explained by the following picture.

<P/><Alt Only="HTML">&lt;img src="images/cocycle.png" align="center" height="200" alt="2-cocycle equation"/>
</Alt>

<P/>
The definition of a cocycle clearly depends on the choice of <M>\mathbb ZG</M>-resolution <M>R_\ast</M>. However, the cohomology group <M>H^n(G,A)</M>, which is a group of equivalence classes of <M>n</M>-cocycles, is independent of the choice of <M>R_\ast</M>. 

<P/>
There are some occasions when one needs explicit examples of standard cocycles. For instance:

<List>
<Item>    Let <M>G</M> be a finite group and <M>k</M>
a field of characteristic <M>0</M>. The group algebra <M>k(G)</M>,
 and the algebra <M>F(G)</M> of functions 
<M>d_g\colon G\rightarrow k, h\rightarrow d_{g,h}</M>,
 are both Hopf algebras. The tensor product <M>F(G) \otimes k(G)</M>
 also admits a Hopf algebra structure known as the quantum double <M>D(G)</M>. 
A twisted quantum double <M>D_f(G)</M> was introduced by 
R. Dijkraaf, V. Pasquier &amp; P. Roche <Cite Key="dpr"/>. 
The twisted double is a quasi-Hopf algebra depending on a <M>3</M>-cocycle 
<M>f\colon G\times G\times G\rightarrow k</M>. The multiplication is given by 
<M>(d_g \otimes x)(d_h \otimes y) = d_{gx,xh}\beta_g(x,y)(d_g \otimes xy)</M> where <M>\beta_a </M>
is defined by <M>\beta_a(h,g) = f(a,h,g) f(h,h^{-1}ah,g)^{-1} f(h,g,(hg)^{-1}ahg)</M> .  Although the algebraic structure of <M>D_f(G)</M> depends very much on the particular <M>3</M>-cocycle <M>f</M>, representation-theoretic properties of <M>D_f(G)</M> depend only on the cohomology class of <M>f</M>.
</Item>
<Item>    An explicit <M>2</M>-cocycle <M>f\colon G\times G\rightarrow A</M> is needed to construct the multiplication <M>(a,g)(a',g') = (a + g\cdot a' + f(g,g'),  gg')</M> in the extension a group <M>G</M> by a <M>\mathbb ZG</M>-module 
<M>A</M> determined by the cohomology class of <M>f</M> in <M>H^2(G,A)</M>.
See <Ref Sect="secExtensions"/>.
</Item>
<Item>    In work on coding theory and Hadamard matrices a number of papers have investigated square matrices <M>(a_{ij})</M> whose entries <M>a_{ij}=f(g_i,g_j)</M>
 are the values of a <M>2</M>-cocycle <M>f\colon G\times G \rightarrow
 \mathbb Z_2</M>
 where <M>G</M> is a finite group acting trivially on <M>\mathbb Z_2</M>. See for instance <Cite Key="horadam"/> and <Ref Sect="secHadamard"/>.

<P/>
Given a <M>\mathbb ZG</M>-resolution <M>R_\ast</M>
 (with contracting homotopy) and a <M>\mathbb ZG</M>-module <M>A</M>
 one can use HAP commands to compute explicit standard <M>n</M>-cocycles 
<M>f\colon G^n \rightarrow A</M>. With the twisted quantum double in mind, we illustrate the computation for <M>n=3</M>, <M>G=S_3</M>, and <M>A=U(1)</M>
 the group of complex numbers of modulus <M>1</M> with trivial <M>G</M>-action.

<P/>
We first compute a <M>\mathbb ZG</M>-resolution <M>R_\ast</M>. The Universal Coefficient Theorem gives an isomorphism <M>H_3(G,U(1)) = Hom_{\mathbb Z}(H_3(G,\mathbb Z), U(1))</M>, The multiplicative group <M>U(1)</M> can thus be viewed as 
<M>\mathbb Z_m</M> where <M>m</M> is a multiple of the exponent of <M>H_3(G,\mathbb Z)</M>.

<Example>
<#Include SYSTEM "tutex/6.20.txt">
</Example>

<P/>
We thus replace the very infinite group U(1) by the finite cyclic group <M>\mathbb Z_6</M>. Since the resolution <M>R_\ast </M> has <M>4</M> generators in degree <M>3</M>, a homomorphism <M>f\colon R^3\rightarrow U(1)</M> can 
be represented by a list <M>f=[f_1, f_2, f_3, f_4]</M> with <M>f_i</M>
  the image in <M>\mathbb Z_6</M> of the <M>i</M>th generator. The cocycle condition on <M>f</M> can be expressed as a matrix equation

<P/><M>Mf^t = 0  \bmod 6</M>.

<P/>
where the matrix <M>M</M> is obtained from the following command and <M>f^t</M> denotes the transpose.
<Example>
<#Include SYSTEM "tutex/6.21.txt">

A particular cocycle <M>f=[f_1, f_2, f_3, f_4]</M> can be obtained by choosing a solution to the equation Mf^t=0.

A non-standard <M>3</M>-cocycle <M>f</M> can be converted to a standard one using the command  <Code>StandardCocycle(R,f,n,q)</Code> . This command inputs 
<M>  R_\ast</M>, integers <M>n</M> and <M>q</M>, and an <M>n</M>-cocycle <M>f</M> for the resolution <M>R_\ast</M>. It returns a standard cocycle <M>G^n \rightarrow \mathbb Z_q</M>.

A function <M>f\colon G\times G\times G \rightarrow A</M>
