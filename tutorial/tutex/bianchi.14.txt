gap> P:=BianchiPolyhedron(-46);
Try 
  P:=BianchiPolyhedron(OQ,N);
for some guessed positive integer value of N and then try
  SwanBianchiCriterion(P);
to test if the value of N was large enough. If the test returns false then you\
'll need to try a larger value of N.

A successful value of N can be stored as a pair [d,N] in the list HAPRECORD wh\
ich can be edited manually in the file hap/lib/Congruence/bianchi.gi .


gap> P:=BianchiPolyhedron(-46,600);
3-dimensional Bianchi polyhedron over OQ( Sqrt(
-46) ) involving hemispheres of minimum squared radius 1/
441 and non-cuspidal vertices of minimum squared height 1/8280 . 

gap> SwanBianchiCriterion(P);
true
