<Chapter Label="resolutions"><Heading>Resolutions</Heading>

There is a range of functions in HAP that input a group <M>G</M>, integer <M>n</M>, and attempt to return the first <M>n</M> terms of a free <M>\mathbb ZG</M>-resolution <M>R_\ast</M> of the trivial module <M>\mathbb Z</M>. In some cases an explicit contracting homotopy  is provided on the resolution.

The function <Code>Size(R)</Code> returns a list whose <M>k</M>th term is the sum of the lengths of the boundaries of the generators in degree <M>k</M>.

<Section><Heading>Resolutions for very small finite groups</Heading>

The following uses linear algebra over <M>\mathbb Z</M> to construct a 
resolution.
<Example>
<#Include SYSTEM "tutex/14.2.txt">
</Example>
The suspicion that this resolution <M>R_\ast</M>
is periodic of period <M>4</M> can be verified by 
 constructing the chain complex <M>C_\ast=R_\ast\otimes_{\mathbb Z}\mathbb ZG</M> and verifying that boundary matrices repeat with period <M>4</M>.

<P/> A second example of a periodic resolution, for the Dihedral group 
<M>D_{2k+1}=\langle x, y\ |\ x^2= xy^kx^{-1}y^{-k-1}\rangle</M> of order <M>2k+2</M> in the case <M>k=1</M>, is constructed and verified for periodicity in the next example.

This periodic resolution for <M>D_3</M> can be found in a paper by R. Swan
<Cite Key="swan2"/>. The resolution was proved for arbitrary <M>D_{2k+1}</M>
by Irina Kholodna <Cite Key="kholodna"/> (Corollary 5.5)
 and is the cellular chain complex of the universal cover of a CW-complex <M>X</M> with two cells in dimensions <M>1, 2 \bmod 4</M> and one cell in dimensions <M>0,3 \bmod 4</M>. The <M>2</M>-skelecton is the <M>2</M>-complex for the given presentation of <M>D_{2k+1}</M> and an attaching map for the <M>3</M>-cell is represented as follows.

<P/>
A slightly different periodic resolution for <M>D_{2k+1}</M> has been obtain more recently by FEA Johnson <Cite Key="johnson"/>. Johnson's resolution has two free generators in each degree. Interestingly, running the following code for many values of <M>k &gt;1</M> seems to produce a periodic resolution with  two free generators in each degree for most values of <M>k</M>.

The following uses Polymake convex hull computations and homological perturbation theory to construct a resolution.

The convex polytope <M>P_G(v)={\rm Convex~Hull}\{g\cdot v\ |\ g\in G\}</M>
used in the resolution depends on the choice of vector <M>v\in \mathbb R^n</M>. Two such polytopes for the alternating group <M>G=A_4</M> acting on <M>\mathbb R^4</M> can be visualized as follows.

<Section><Heading>Resolutions for <M>\mathbb FG</M>-modules
</Heading>
Let <M>\mathbb F=\mathbb F_p</M> be the field of <M>p</M> elements and let 
<M>M</M> be some <M>\mathbb FG</M>-module.    We might wish to construct a free <M>\mathbb FG</M>-resolution for <M>M</M>. We can handle this by
constructing a short exact sequence
<P/><M>    DM  \rightarrowtail P \twoheadrightarrow M</M>
<P/> in which <M>P</M> is free (or projective). Then any resolution of <M>DM</M>
yields a resolution of <M>M</M> and we can represent <M>DM</M> as a submodule
of <M>P</M>. We refer to <M>DM</M> as the <E>desuspension</E> of <M>M</M>.

Consider for instance <M>G=Syl_2(GL(4,2))</M> and <M>\mathbb F=\mathbb F_2</M>. The matrix group <M>G</M> acts via matrix
multiplication on <M>M=\mathbb F^4</M>. The following example constructs a free <M>\mathbb FG</M>-resolution for <M>M</M>.
