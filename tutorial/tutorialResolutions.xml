<Chapter Label="resolutions"><Heading>Resolutions</Heading>

There is a range of functions in HAP that input a group <M>G</M>, integer <M>n</M>, and attempt to return the first <M>n</M> terms of a free <M>\mathbb ZG</M>-resolution <M>R_\ast</M> of the trivial module <M>\mathbb Z</M>. In some cases an explicit contracting homotopy  is provided on the resolution.

The function <Code>Size(R)</Code> returns a list whose <M>k</M>th term is the sum of the lengths of the boundaries of the generators in degree <M>k</M>.

The following uses Polymake convex hull computations and homological perturbation theory to construct a resolution.

The convex polytope <M>P_G(v)={\rm Convex~Hull}\{g\cdot v\ |\ g\in G\}</M>
used in the resolution depends on the choice of vector <M>v\in \mathbb R^n</M>. Two such polytopes for the alternating group <M>G=A_4</M> acting on <M>\mathbb R^4</M> can be visualized as follows.
