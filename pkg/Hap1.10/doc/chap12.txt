  [10XCayleyGraphOfGroupDisplay(G,X) [0m
  [10XCayleyGraphOfGroupDisplay(G,X,"mozilla") [0m
  
  Inputs  a  finite  group  G  together  with a subset X of G. It displays the
  corresponding  Cayley  graph as a .gif file. It uses the Mozilla web browser
  as  a default to view the diagram. An alternative browser can be set using a
  second argument.
  
  The argument G can also be a finite set of elements in a (possibly infinite)
  group  containing  X. The edges of the graph are coloured according to which
  element  of  X  they  are labelled by. The list X corresponds to the list of
  colours [blue, red, green, yellow, brown, black] in that order.
  
  This function requires Graphviz software.

  [10XIdentityAmongRelatorsDisplay(R,n) [0m
  [10XIdentityAmongRelatorsDisplay(R,n,"mozilla") [0m
  
  Inputs  a  free  ZG-resolution  R and an integer n. It displays the boundary
  R!.boundary(3,n) as a tessellation of a sphere. It displays the tessellation
  as  a  .gif  file  and  uses  the  Mozilla  web browser as a default display
  mechanism.  An  alternative browser can be set using a second argument. (The
  resolution  R  should  be  reduced and, preferably, in dimension 1 it should
  correspond to a Cayley graph for G. )
  
  This function uses GraphViz software.

  [10XIsAspherical(F,R) [0m
  
  Inputs  a  free group F and a set R of words in F. It performs a test on the
  2-dimensional  CW-space  K  associated  to  this  presentation for the group
  G=F/<R>^F.
  
  The  function returns "true" if K has trivial second homotopy group. In this
  case it prints: Presentation is aspherical.
  
  Otherwise  it  returns  "fail"  and  prints:  Presentation is NOT piece-wise
  Euclidean non-positively curved. (In this case K may or may not have trivial
  second  homotopy group. But it is NOT possible to impose a metric on K which
  restricts to a Euclidean metric on each 2-cell.)
  
  The function uses Polymake software.

  [10XPresentationOfResolution(R) [0m
  
  Inputs  at least two terms of a reduced ZG-resolution R and returns a record
  P with components
  P.freeGroup is a free group F,
  P.relators is a list S of words in F,
  P.gens  is  a  list of positive integers such that the i-th generator of the
  presentation corresponds to the group element R!.elts[P[i]] .
  where G is isomorphic to F modulo the normal closure of S. This presentation
  for G corresponds to the 2-skeleton of the classifying CW-space from which R
  was constructed. The resolution R requires no contracting homotopy.

  [10XTorsionGeneratorsAbelianGroup(G) [0m
  
  Inputs an abelian group G and returns a generating set [x_1, ... ,x_n] where
  no pair of generators have coprime orders.
