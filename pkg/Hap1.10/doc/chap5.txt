  [10XChainComplex(T)[0m
  
  Inputs  a  pure cubical complex, or cubical complex, or simplicial complex T
  and returns the (often very large) cellular chain complex of T.

  [10XChainComplexOfPair(T,S)[0m
  
  Inputs  a  pure  cubical  complex  or  cubical  complex  T  and contractible
  subcomplex S. It returns the quotient C(T)/C(S) of cellular chain complexes.

  [10X ChevalleyEilenbergComplex(X,n) [0m
  
  Inputs either a Lie algebra X=A (over the ring of integers Z or over a field
  K) or a homomorphism of Lie algebras X=(f:A --> B), together with a positive
  integer  n.  It  returns either the first n terms of the Chevalley-Eilenberg
  chain  complex  C(A),  or  the  induced map of Chevalley-Eilenberg complexes
  C(f):C(A) --> C(B).
  
  (The  homology  of the Chevalley-Eilenberg complex C(A) is by definition the
  homology of the Lie algebra A with trivial coefficients in Z or K).

  [10X LeibnizComplex(X,n) [0m
  
  Inputs  either  a Lie or Leibniz algebra X=A (over the ring of integers Z or
  over  a field K) or a homomorphism of Lie or Leibniz algebras X=(f:A --> B),
  together  with  a positive integer n. It returns either the first n terms of
  the  Leibniz  chain  complex  C(A),  or the induced map of Leibniz complexes
  C(f):C(A) --> C(B).
  
  (The  Leibniz  complex  C(A)  was  defined by J.-L.Loday. Its homology is by
  definition the Leibniz homology of the algebra A).

  [10XSuspendedChainComplex(C)[0m
  
  Inputs a chain complex C and returns the chain complex S defined by applying
  the degree shift S_n = C_n-1 to chain groups and boundary homomorphisms.
  ::::::::::::::::::::::::
  [10XReducedSuspendedChainComplex(C)[0m
  
  Inputs a chain complex C and returns the chain complex S defined by applying
  the  degree shift S_n = C_n-1 to chain groups and boundary homomorphisms for
  all n > 0. The chain complex S has trivial homology in degree 0 and S_0= Z.

  [10XCoreducedChainComplex(C)[0m
  [10XCoreducedChainComplex(C,2)[0m
  
  Inputs  a chain complex C and returns a quasi-isomorphic chain complex D. In
  many  cases  the  complex  D should be smaller than C. If an optional second
  input  argument  is  set  equal  to 2 then an alternative method is used for
  reducing the size of the chain complex.

  [10XTensorProductOfChainComplexes(C,D)[0m
  
  Inputs  two  chain  complexes C and D of the same characteristic and returns
  their tensor product as a chain complex.

  [10XLefschetzNumber(F)[0m
  
  Inputs  a  chain  map F: C-> C with common source and target. It returns the
  Lefschetz  number  of the map (that is, the alternating sum of the traces of
  the homology maps in each degree).
