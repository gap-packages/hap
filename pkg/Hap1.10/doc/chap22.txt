  [10X Bettinumbers(T)[0m
  
  Inputs  a  pure  cubical  complex, or cubical complex, simplicial complex or
  chain  complex T and a non-negative integer n. The rank of the n-th rational

  [10XCechComplexOfPureCubicalComplex(T)[0m
  
  Inputs  a  d-dimensional  pure  cubical  complex  T and returns a simplicial
  complex S. The simplicial complex S has one vertex for each d-cube in T, and
  an  n-simplex  for  each  collection  of n+1 d-cubes with non-trivial common
  intersection. The homotopy types of T and S are equal.

  [10XPureComplexToSimplicialComplex(T,k)[0m
  
  Inputs either a d-dimensional pure cubical complex T or a d-dimensional pure
  permutahedral  complex  T together with a non-negative integer k. It returns
  the  first  k dimensions of a simplicial complex S. The simplicial complex S
  has one vertex for each d-cell in T, and an n-simplex for each collection of
  n+1  d-cells  with  non-trivial common intersection. The homotopy types of T
  and S are equal.
  
  For a pure cubical complex T this uses a slightly different algorithm to the
  function   CechComplexOfPureCubicalComplex(T)   but   constructs   the  same
  simplicial complex.

  [10XVectorsToSymmetricMatrix(M,distance)[0m
  
  Inputs a matrix M of rational numbers and returns a symmetric matrix S whose
  (i,j)  entry  is  the distance between the i-th row and j-th rows of M where
