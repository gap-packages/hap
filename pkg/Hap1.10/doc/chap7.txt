  Inputs  a  prime-power  group  G  and, optionally, a positive integer k. The
  default  is k=4. The function returns a list of normal subgroups N in G such
  that  the  Poincare  series  for G equals the Poincare series for the direct
  product (N x (G/N)) up to degree k.

  Inputs a positive integer n and a rational function f(x)=p(x)/q(x) where the
  degree  of  the polynomial p(x) is less than that of q(x). It returns a list
  [a_0  ,  a_1  ,  a_2  , a_3 , ... ,a_n] of the first n+1 coefficients of the
  infinite expansion
  
  f(x) = a_0 + a_1x + a_2x^2 + a_3x^3 + ... .

  Inputs a finite p-group G and a positive integer n. It returns a quotient of
  polynomials  f(x)=P(x)/Q(x)  whose coefficient of x^k equals the rank of the
  vector space H_k(G,Z_p) for all k in the range k=1 to k=n. (The second input
  variable  can  be  omitted,  in  which  case  the function tries to choose a
  "reasonable" value for n. For 2-groups the function PoincareSeriesLHS(G) can
  be used to produce an f(x) that is correct in all degrees.)
  
  In  place of the group G the function can also input (at least n terms of) a
  minimal mod p resolution R for G.
  
  Alternatively, the first input variable can be a list L of integers. In this
  case  the  coefficient  of  x^k  in f(x) is equal to the (k+1)st term in the
  list.

  Inputs  a  finite group G, a prime p, and a positive integer n. It returns a
  quotient  of  polynomials f(x)=P(x)/Q(x) whose coefficient of x^k equals the
  rank of the vector space H_k(G,Z_p) for all k in the range k=1 to k=n.
  
  The efficiency of this function needs to be improved.

  Inputs   a   finite   2-group  G  and  returns  a  quotient  of  polynomials
  f(x)=P(x)/Q(x)  whose coefficient of x^k equals the rank of the vector space
  H_k(G,Z_2) for all k.
