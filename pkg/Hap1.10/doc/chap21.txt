  [10XCoxeterDiagramComponents(D) [0m
  
  Inputs a Coxeter diagram D and returns a list [D_1, ..., D_d] of the maximal
  connected subgraphs D_i.
  ::::::::::::::::::::::::
  [10XCoxeterDiagramDegree(D,v) [0m
  
  Inputs  a  Coxeter  diagram D and vertex v. It returns the degree of v (i.e.
  the number of edges incident with v).
  ::::::::::::::::::::::::
  [10XCoxeterDiagramDisplay(D) [0m
  [10XCoxeterDiagramDisplay(D,"web browser") [0m
  
  Inputs  a  Coxeter  diagram  D  and  displays it as a .gif file. It uses the
  Mozilla web browser as a default to view the diagram. An alternative browser
  can be set using a second argument.
  
  This function requires Graphviz software.

  [10XCoxeterDiagramFpArtinGroup(D) [0m
  
  Inputs  a Coxeter diagram D and returns the corresponding finitely presented
  Artin group.
  ::::::::::::::::::::::::
  [10XCoxeterDiagramFpCoxeterGroup(D) [0m
  
  Inputs  a Coxeter diagram D and returns the corresponding finitely presented
  Coxeter group.
  ::::::::::::::::::::::::
  [10XCoxeterDiagramIsSpherical(D) [0m
  
  Inputs  a  Coxeter  diagram  D  and returns "true" if the associated Coxeter
  groups is finite, and returns "false" otherwise.
  ::::::::::::::::::::::::
  [10XCoxeterDiagramMatrix(D) [0m
  
  Inputs  a  Coxeter  diagram D and returns a matrix representation of it. The
  matrix is given as a function DiagramMatrix(D)(i,j) where i,j can range over
  the vertices.
  ::::::::::::::::::::::::
  [10XCoxeterSubDiagram(D,V) [0m
  
  Inputs  a  Coxeter  diagram D and a subset V of its vertices. It returns the
  full sub-diagram of D with vertex set V.
  ::::::::::::::::::::::::
  [10XCoxeterDiagramVertices(D) [0m
  
  Inputs a Coxeter diagram D and returns its set of vertices.
  ::::::::::::::::::::::::
  [10XEvenSubgroup(G) [0m
  
  Inputs  a group G and returns a subgroup G^+. The subgroup is that generated
  by  all products xy where x and y range over the generating set for G stored
  by  GAP.  The  subgroup  is  probably  only meaningful when G is an Artin or
  Coxeter group.
  ::::::::::::::::::::::::
  [10X GraphOfGroupsDisplay(D) [0m
  [10XGraphOfGroupsDisplay(D,"web browser") [0m
  
  Inputs  a  graph  of  groups  D  and displays it as a .gif file. It uses the
  Mozilla web browser as a default to view the diagram. An alternative browser
  can be set using a second argument.
  
  This function requires Graphviz software.
  ::::::::::::::::::::::::
  [10X GraphOfResolutions(D,n) [0m
  
  Inputs  a  graph of groups D and a positive integer n. It returns a graph of
  resolutions,  each  resolution  being  of  length  n.  It  uses the function
  ResolutionGenericGroup() to produce the resolutions.
  ::::::::::::::::::::::::
  [10X GraphOfGroups(D) [0m
  
  Inputs  a  graph  of  resolutions  D  and returns the corresponding graph of
  groups.
  ::::::::::::::::::::::::
  [10X GraphOfResolutionsDisplay(D) [0m
  
  Inputs  a graph of resolutions D and displays it as a .gif file. It uses the
  Mozilla web browser as a default to view the diagram.
  
  This function requires Graphviz software.
  ::::::::::::::::::::::::
  [10XGraphOfGroupsTest(D) [0m
  
  Inputs  an  object  D  and  itries  to test whether it is a Graph of Groups.
  However,  it  DOES NOT test the injectivity of any homomorphisms. It returns
  true if D passes the test, and false otherwise.
  
  Note  that there is no function IsHapGraphOfGroups() because no special data
  type has been created for these graphs.
  ::::::::::::::::::::::::
  [10XTreeOfGroupsToContractibleGcomplex(D,G) [0m
  
  Inputs  a graph of groups D which is a tree, and also inputs the fundamental
  group G of the tree in a form which contains each of the groups in the graph
  as subgroups. It returns a corresponding contractible G-complex.
  ::::::::::::::::::::::::
  [10XTreeOfResolutionsToContractibleGcomplex(D,G) [0m
  
  Inputs  a  graph  of  resolutions  D  which  is  a tree, and also inputs the
  fundamental  group G of the tree in a form which contains each of the groups
  in   the  graph  as  subgroups.  It  returns  a  corresponding  contractible
  G-complex.  The  resolutions  are  stored as a component of the contractible
  G-complex.
