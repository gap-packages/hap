 \begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|l|} \index{TietzeReducedResolution} \texttt{TietzeReducedResolution(R)} 

 Inputs a $\mathbb ZG$-resolution $R$ and returns a $\mathbb ZG$-resolution $S$ which is obtained from $R$ by applying "Tietze like operations" in each dimension. The hope is that $S$ has fewer free generators than $R$. \\
 \index{ResolutionArithmeticGroup} \texttt{ResolutionArithmeticGroup("PSL(4,Z)",n)} 

 Inputs a positive integer $n$ and one of the following strings: \\
\\
 "SL(2,Z)" , "SL(3,Z)" , "PGL(3,Z[i])" ,
"PGL(3,Eisenstein{\textunderscore}Integers)" , "PSL(4,Z)" ,
"PSL(4,Z){\textunderscore}b" , "PSL(4,Z){\textunderscore}c" ,
"PSL(4,Z){\textunderscore}d" , "Sp(4,Z)" \\
\\
 or one of the following strings \\
\\
 "SL(2,Z[sqrt(-2)])" , "SL(2,Z[sqrt(-7)])" , "SL(2,Z[sqrt(-11)])" ,
"SL(2,Z[sqrt(-19)])" , "SL(2,Z[sqrt(-43)])" , "SL(2,Z[sqrt(-67)])" ,
"SL(2,Z[sqrt(-163)])" \\
\\
 It returns $n$ terms of a free ZG-resolution for the group $G$ described by the string. (Subscripts {\textunderscore}b , {\textunderscore}c ,
{\textunderscore}d denote alternative non-free ZG-resolutions for a given
group G.)\\
\\
 Data for the first list of resolutions was provided provided by \textsc{Mathieu Dutour}. Data for the second list was provided by \textsc{Alexander Rahm}.\\
 \index{FreeGResolution} \texttt{FreeGResolution(P,n)} \texttt{FreeGResolution(P,n,p)} 

 Inputs a non-free $ZG$-resolution $P$ with finite stabilizer groups, and a positive integer $n$. It returns a free $ZG$-resolution of length equal to the minimum of n and the length of $P$. If one requires only a mod $p$ resolution then the prime $p$ can be entered as an optional third argument. 

 The free resolution is returned without a contracting homotopy. \\
 \index{ResolutionGTree} \texttt{ResolutionGTree(P,n)} 

 Inputs a non-free $ZG$-resolution $P$ of dimension 1 (i.e. a G-tree) with finite stabilizer groups, and a positive
integer $n$. It returns a free $ZG$-resolution of length equal to n. 

 If $P$ has a contracting homotopy then the free resolution is returned with a
contracting homotopy. 

 This function was written by \textsc{ Bui Anh Tuan}. \\
 \index{ResolutionSL2Z} \texttt{ResolutionSL2Z(p,n)} 

 Inputs positive integers $m, n$ and returns $n$ terms of a $ZG$-resolution for the group $G=SL(2,Z[1/m])$ . 

 

 This function is joint work with \textsc{Bui Anh Tuan}. \\
 \index{ResolutionAbelianGroup} \texttt{ResolutionAbelianGroup(L,n)} \texttt{ResolutionAbelianGroup(G,n)} 

 Inputs a list $L:=[m_1,m_2, ..., m_d]$ of nonnegative integers, and a positive integer $n$. It returns $n$ terms of a $ZG$-resolution for the abelian group $G=Z_L[1]+Z_L[2]+{\textperiodcentered}{\textperiodcentered}{\textperiodcentered}+Z_L[d]$ . 

 If $G$ is finite then the first argument can also be the abelian group $G$ itself. \\
 \index{ResolutionAlmostCrystalGroup} \texttt{ResolutionAlmostCrystalGroup(G,n)} 

 Inputs a positive integer $n$ and an almost crystallographic pcp group $G$. It returns $n$ terms of a free $ZG$-resolution. (A group is almost crystallographic if it is nilpotent-by-finite
and has no non-trivial finite normal subgroup. Such groups can be constructed
using the ACLIB package.) \\
 \index{ResolutionAlmostCrystalQuotient} \texttt{ResolutionAlmostCrystalQuotient(G,n,c)} \texttt{ResolutionAlmostCrystalQuotient(G,n,c,false)} 

 An almost crystallographic group $G$ is an extension of a finite group $P$ by a nilpotent group $T$, and has no non-trivial finite normal subgroup. We define the relative lower
central series by setting $T_1=T$ and $T_{i+1}=[T_i,G]$.

 This function inputs an almost crystallographic group $G$ together with positive integers $n$ and $c$. It returns $n$ terms of a free $ZQ$-resolution $R$ for the group $Q=G/T_c$ .

 In addition to the usual components, the resolution $R$ has the component $R.quotientHomomorphism$ which gives the quotient homomorphism $G \longrightarrow Q $.

 If a fourth optional variable is set equal to "false" then the function omits
to test whether $Q$ is finite and a "more canonical" resolution is constructed. \\
 \index{ResolutionArtinGroup} \texttt{ResolutionArtinGroup(D,n)} 

 Inputs a Coxeter diagram $D$ and an integer $n>1$. It returns $n$ terms of a free $ZG$-resolution $R$ where $G$ is the Artin monoid associated to $D$. It is conjectured that $R$ is also a free resolution for the Artin group $G$. The conjecture is known to hold in \href{../www/SideLinks/About/aboutArtinGroups.html} {certain cases}.

 $G=R.group$ is infinite and returned as a finitely presented group. The list $R.elts$ is a partial listing of the elements of $G$ which grows as $R$ is used. Initially $R.elts$ is empty and then, any time the boundary of a resolution generator is called, $R.elts$ is updated to include elements of $G$ involved in the boundary.

 The contracting homotopy on $R$ has not yet been implemented! Furthermore, the group $G$ is currently returned only as a finitely presented group (without any method
for solving the word problem). \\
 \index{ResolutionAsphericalPresentation} \texttt{ResolutionAsphericalPresentation(F,R,n)} 

 Inputs a free group $F$, a set $R$ of words in $F$ which constitute an aspherical presentation for a group $G$, and a positive integer $n$. (Asphericity can be a difficult property to verify. The function $IsAspherical(F,R)$ could be of help.)

 The function returns n terms of a free $ZG$-resolution $R$ which has generators in dimensions {\textless} 3 only. No contracting homotopy
on $R$ will be returned. \\
 \index{ResolutionBieberbachGroup (HAPcryst)} \texttt{ResolutionBieberbachGroup( G ) } \texttt{ResolutionBieberbachGroup( G, v ) } 

 Inputs a torsion free crystallographic group $G$, also known as a Bieberbach group, represented using AffineCrystGroupOnRight
as in the GAP package Cryst. It also optionally inputs a choice of vector $v$ in the euclidean space $R^n$ on which $G$ acts freely. The function returns $n+1$ terms of the free $ZG$-resolution of $Z$ arising as the cellular chain complex of the tesselation of $R^n$ by the Dirichlet-Voronoi fundamental domain determined by $v$. 

 This function is part of the HAPcryst package written by \textsc{Marc Roeder} and thus requires the HAPcryst package to be loaded. 

 The function requires the use of Polymake software. \\
 \index{ResolutionCoxeterGroup} \texttt{ResolutionCoxeterGroup(D,n)} 

 Inputs a Coxeter diagram $D$ and an integer $n>1$. It returns $k$ terms of a free $ZG$-resolution $R$ where $G$ is the Coxeter group associated to $D$. Here $k$ is the maximum of n and the number of vertices in the Coxeter diagram. At
present the implementation is only for finite Coxeter groups and the group $G$ is returned as a permutation group. The contracting homotopy on $R$ has not yet been implemented! \\
 \index{ResolutionDirectProduct} \texttt{ResolutionDirectProduct(R,S) } \texttt{ResolutionDirectProduct(R,S,"internal")} 

 Inputs a $ZG$-resolution $R$ and $ZH$-resolution $S$. It outputs a $ZD$-resolution for the direct product $D=G x H$.

 If $G$ and $H$ lie in a common group $K$, and if they commute and have trivial intersection, then an optional third
variable "internal" can be used. This will force $D$ to be the subgroup $GH$ in $K$. \\
 \index{ResolutionExtension} \texttt{ResolutionExtension(g,R,S) } \texttt{ResolutionExtension(g,R, S,"TestFiniteness")} \texttt{ResolutionExtension(g,R,S,"NoTest",GmapE)} 

 Inputs a surjective group homomorphism $g:E \longrightarrow G$ with kernel $N$. It also inputs a $ZN$-resolution $R$ and a $ZG$-resolution $S$. It returns a $ZE$-resolution. The groups $E$ and $G$ can be infinite.

 If an optional fourth argument is set equal to "TestFiniteness" then the
groups $N$ and $G$ will be tested to see if they are finite. If they are finite then some speed
saving routines will be invoked.

 If the homomorphism $g$ is such that the GAP function $PreImagesElement(g,x)$ doesn't work, then a function $GmapE()$ should be included as a fifth input. For any $x$ in $G$ this function should return an element $GmapE(x)$ in $E$ which gets mapped onto $x$ by $g$.

 The contracting homotopy on the $ZE$-resolution has not yet been fully implemented for infinite groups! \\
 \index{ResolutionFiniteDirectProduct} \texttt{ResolutionFiniteDirectProduct(R,S) } \texttt{ResolutionFiniteDirectProduct(R,S, "internal")} 

 Inputs a $ZG$-resolution $R$ and $ZH$-resolution $S$ where $G$ and $H$ are finite groups. It outputs a $ZD$-resolution for the direct product $D=G{\ensuremath{\times}}H$.

 If $G$ and $H$ lie in a common group $K$, and if they commute and have trivial intersection, then an optional third
variable "internal" can be used. This will force $D$ to be the subgroup $GH$ in $K$. \\
 \index{ResolutionFiniteExtension} \texttt{ResolutionFiniteExtension(gensE,gensG,R,n)} \texttt{ResolutionFiniteExtension(gensE,gensG,R,n,true) } \texttt{ResolutionFiniteExtension(gensE,gensG,R,n,false,S) } 

 Inputs: a set $gensE$ of generators for a finite group $E$; a set $gensG$ equal to the image of $gensE$ in a quotient group $G$ of $E$; a $ZG$-resolution $R$ up to dimension at least $n$; a positive integer $n$. It uses the $TwistedTensorProduct()$ construction to return $n$ terms of a $ZE$-resolution.

 The function has an optional fourth argument which, when set equal to "true",
invokes tietze reductions in the construction of a resolution for the kernel
of $E \longrightarrow G$.

 If a $ZN$-resolution $S$ is available, where $N$ is the kernel of the quotient $E \longrightarrow G$, then this can be incorporated into the computations using an optional fifth
argument. \\
 \index{ResolutionFiniteGroup} \texttt{ResolutionFiniteGroup(gens,n)} \texttt{ResolutionFiniteGroup(gens,n,true)} \texttt{ResolutionFiniteGroup(gens,n,false,p) } \texttt{ResolutionFiniteGroup(gens,n,false,0,"extendible") } 

 Inputs a set $gens$ of generators for a finite group $G$ and a positive integer $n$. It outputs $n$ terms of a $ZG$-resolution.

 The function has an optional third argument which, when set equal to $true$, invokes tietze reductions in the construction of the resolution. 

 The function has an optional fourth argument which, when set equal to a prime $p$, records the fact that the resolution will only be used for mod $p$ calculations. This could speed up subsequent constructions. 

 The function has an optional fifth argument which, when set equal to
"extendible", returns a resolution whose length can be increased using the
command R!.extend() . \\
 \index{ResolutionFiniteSubgroup} \texttt{ResolutionFiniteSubgroup(R,K)} \texttt{ResolutionFiniteSubgroup(R,gensG,gensK)} 

 Inputs a $ZG$-resolution for a finite group $G$ and a subgroup $K$ of index $|G:K|$. It returns a free $ZK$-resolution whose $ZK$-rank is $|G:K|$ times the $ZG$-rank in each dimension.

 Generating sets $gensG$, $gensK$ for $G$ and $K$ can also be input to the function (though the method does not depend on a
choice of generators).

 This $ZK$-resolution is not reduced. ie. it has more than one generator in dimension $0$. \\
 \index{ResolutionGraphOfGroups} \texttt{ResolutionGraphOfGroups(D,n) } \texttt{ResolutionGraphOfGroups(D,n,L) } 

 Inputs a graph of groups $D$ and a positive integer $n$. It returns $n$ terms of a free $ZG$-resolution for the fundamental group $G$ of $D$.

 An optional third argument $L=[R_1 , \ldots , R_t]$ can be used to list (in any order) free resolutions for some/all of the vertex
and edge groups in $D$. If for some vertex or edge group no resolution is listed in $L$ then the function $ResolutionFiniteGroup()$ will be used to try to construct the resolution. 

 The $ZG$-resolution is usually not reduced. i.e. it has more than one generator in
dimension 0.

 The contracting homotopy on the $ZG$-resolution has not yet been implemented! Furthermore, the group $G$ is currently returned only as a finitely presented group (without any method
for solving the word problem). \\
 \index{ResolutionNilpotentGroup} \texttt{ResolutionNilpotentGroup(G,n) } \texttt{ResolutionNilpotentGroup(G,n,"TestFiniteness")} 

 Inputs a nilpotent group $G$ and positive integer $n$. It returns $n$ terms of a free $ZG$-resolution. The resolution is computed using a divide-and-conquer technique
involving the lower central series.

 This function can be applied to infinite groups $G$. For finite groups the function $ResolutionNormalSeries()$ probably gives better results.

 If an optional third argument is set equal to "TestFiniteness" then the groups $N$ and $G$ will be tested to see if they are finite. If they are finite then some speed
saving routines will be invoked.

 The contracting homotopy on the $ZE$-resolution has not yet been fully implemented for infinite groups. \\
 \index{ResolutionNormalSeries} \texttt{ResolutionNormalSeries(L,n) } \texttt{ResolutionNormalSeries(L,n,true)} \texttt{ResolutionNormalSeries(L,n,false,p)} 

 Inputs a positive integer $n$ and a list $L = [L_1 , ..., L_k]$ of normal subgroups $L_i$ of a finite group $G$ satisfying $G = L_1$ {\textgreater} $L2$ {\textgreater}$ \ldots $ {\textgreater}$ L_k$. Alternatively, $L = [gensL_1, ... gensL_k]$ can be a list of generating sets for the $L_i$ (and these particular generators will be used in the construction of
resolutions). It returns a $ZG$-resolution by repeatedly using the function $ResolutionFiniteExtension()$.

 The function has an optional third argument which, if set equal to true,
invokes tietze reductions in the construction of resolutions.

 The function has an optional fourth argument which, if set equal to p
{\textgreater} 0, produces a resolution which is only valid for mod $p$ calculations. \\
 \index{ResolutionPrimePowerGroup} \texttt{ResolutionPrimePowerGroup(P,n) } \texttt{ResolutionPrimePowerGroup(G,n,p)} 

 Inputs a $p$-group $P$ and integer $n${\textgreater}$0$. It uses GAP's standard linear algebra functions over the field $F$ of p elements to construct a free $FP$-resolution for mod $p$ calculations only. The resolution is minimal - meaning that the number of
generators of $R_n$ equals the rank of $H_n(P,F)$. 

 The function can also be used to obtain a free non-minimal $FG$-resolution of a small group $G$ of non-prime-power order. In this case the prime $p$ must be entered as the third input variable. (In the non-prime-power case the
algorithm is naive and not very good.) \\
 \index{ResolutionSmallFpGroup} \texttt{ResolutionSmallFpGroup(G,n) } \texttt{ResolutionSmallFpGroup(G,n,p) } 

 Inputs a small finitely presented group $G$ and an integer $n${\textgreater}$0$. It returns $n$ terms of a $ZG$-resolution which, in dimensions 1 and 2, corresponds to the given
presentation for $G$. The method returns no contracting homotopy for the resolution.

 The function has an optional fourth argument which, when set equal to a prime $p$, records the fact that the resolution will only be used for mod $p$ calculations. This could speed up subsequent constructions. 

 This function was written by Irina Kholodna. \\
 \index{ResolutionSubgroup} \texttt{ResolutionSubgroup(R,K)} 

 Inputs a $ZG$-resolution for an (infinite) group $G$ and a subgroup $K$ of finite index $|G:K|$. It returns a free $ZK$-resolution whose $ZK$-rank is $|G:K|$ times the $ZG$-rank in each dimension.

 If $G$ is finite then the function $ResolutionFiniteSubgroup(R,G,K)$ will probably work better. In particular, resolutions from this function
probably won't work with the function $EquivariantChainMap()$. This $ZK$-resolution is not reduced. i.e. it has more than one generator in dimension
0. \\
 \index{ResolutionSubnormalSeries} \texttt{ResolutionSubnormalSeries(L,n) } 

 Inputs a positive integer n and a list $L = [L_1 , \ldots , L_k]$ of subgroups $L_i$ of a finite group $G=L_1$ such that $L_1$ {\textgreater} $L2 \ldots $ {\textgreater} $L_k$ is a subnormal series in $G$ (meaning that each $L_{i+1}$ must be normal in $L_i$). It returns a $ZG$-resolution by repeatedly using the function $ResolutionFiniteExtension()$.

 If $L$ is a series of normal subgroups in $G$ then the function $ResolutionNormalSeries(L,n)$ will possibly work more efficiently. \\
 \index{TwistedTensorProduct} \texttt{TwistedTensorProduct(R,S,EhomG,GmapE,NhomE,NEhomN,EltsE,Mult,InvE)} 

 Inputs a $ZG$-resolution $R$, a $ZN$-resolution $S$, and other data relating to a short exact sequence $1 \longrightarrow N \longrightarrow E \longrightarrow G \longrightarrow 1$. It uses a perturbation technique of CTC Wall to construct a $ZE$-resolution $F$. Both $G$ and $N$ could be infinite. The "length" of $F$ is equal to the minimum of the "length"s of $R$ and $S$. The resolution $R$ needs no contracting homotopy if no such homotopy is requied for $F$. \\
 \index{ConjugatedResolution} \texttt{ConjugatedResolution(R,x)} 

 Inputs a ZG-resoluton $R$ and an element $x$ from some group containing $G$. It returns a $ZG^x$-resolution $S$ where the group $G^x$ is the conjugate of $G$ by $x$. (The component $S!.elts$ will be a pseudolist rather than a list.) \\
 \index{RecalculateIncidenceNumbers} \texttt{RecalculateIncidenceNumbers(R)} 

 Inputs a ZG-resoluton $R$ which arises as the cellular chain complex of a regular CW-complex. (Thus the
boundary of any cell is a list of distinct cells.) It recalculates the
incidence numbers for $R$. If it is applied to a resolution that is not regular then a wrong answer may
be returned. \\

 Inputs a $ZG$-resolution $R$, a $ZG'$-resolution $S$, and a group homomorphism $f : G \longrightarrow G'$. It outputs a component object $M$ with the following components. 

 
\begin{itemize}
\item  $M!.source$ is the resolution $R$.
\item  $M!.target$ is the resolution $S$.
\item $M!.mapping(w,n)$ is a function which gives the image in $S_n$, under a chain map induced by $f$, of a word $w$ in $R_n$. (Here $R_n$ and $S_n$ are the $n$-th modules in the resolutions $R$ and $S$.)

 \begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|l|} \index{ExtendScalars} \texttt{ExtendScalars(R,G,EltsG)} 

 Inputs a $ZH$-resolution $R$, a group $G$ containing $H$ as a subgroup, and a list $EltsG$ of elements of $G$. It returns the free $ZG$-resolution $(R \otimes_{ZH} ZG)$. The returned resolution $S$ has S!.elts:=EltsG. This is a resolution of the $ZG$-module $(Z \otimes_{ZH} ZG)$. (Here $\otimes_{ZH}$ means tensor over $ZH$.) \\
 \index{HomToIntegers} \texttt{HomToIntegers(X) } 

 Inputs either a $ZG$-resolution $X=R$, or an equivariant chain map $X = (F:R \longrightarrow S)$. It returns the cochain complex or cochain map obtained by applying $HomZG( _ , Z)$ where $Z$ is the trivial module of integers (characteristic 0). \\
 \index{HomToIntegersModP} \texttt{HomToIntegersModP(R) } 

 Inputs a $ZG$-resolution $R$ and returns the cochain complex obtained by applying $HomZG( _ , Z_p)$ where $Z_p$ is the trivial module of integers mod $p$. (At present this functor does not handle equivariant chain maps.) \\
 \index{HomToIntegralModule} \texttt{HomToIntegralModule(R,f) } 

 Inputs a $ZG$-resolution $R$ and a group homomorphism $f:G \longrightarrow GL_n(Z)$ to the group of $n{\ensuremath{\times}}n$ invertible integer matrices. Here $Z$ must have characteristic 0. It returns the cochain complex obtained by
applying $HomZG( _ , A)$ where $A$ is the $ZG$-module $Z^n$ with $G$ action via $f$. (At present this function does not handle equivariant chain maps.) \\
 \index{TensorWithIntegralModule} \texttt{TensorWithIntegralModule(R,f) } 

 Inputs a $ZG$-resolution $R$ and a group homomorphism $f:G \longrightarrow GL_n(Z)$ to the group of $n{\ensuremath{\times}}n$ invertible integer matrices. Here $Z$ must have characteristic 0. It returns the chain complex obtained by tensoring
over $ZG$ with the $ZG$-module $A=Z^n$ with $G$ action via $f$. (At present this function does not handle equivariant chain maps.) \\
 \index{HomToGModule} \texttt{HomToGModule(R,A) } 

 Inputs a $ZG$-resolution $R$ and an abelian G-outer group A. It returns the G-cocomplex obtained by
applying $HomZG( _ , A)$. (At present this function does not handle equivariant chain maps.) \\
 \index{InduceScalars} \texttt{InduceScalars(R,hom) } 

 Inputs a $ZQ$-resolution $R$ and a surjective group homomorphism $hom:G\rightarrow Q$. It returns the unduced non-free $ZG$-resolution. \\
 \index{LowerCentralSeriesLieAlgebra} \texttt{LowerCentralSeriesLieAlgebra(G) } \texttt{LowerCentralSeriesLieAlgebra(f) } 

 Inputs a pcp group $G$. If each quotient $G_c/G_{c+1}$ of the lower central series is free abelian or p-elementary abelian (for fixed
prime p) then a Lie algebra $L(G)$ is returned. The abelian group underlying $L(G)$ is the direct sum of the quotients $G_c/G_{c+1}$ . The Lie bracket on $L(G)$ is induced by the commutator in $G$. (Here $G_1=G$, $G_{c+1}=[G_c,G]$ .) 

 The function can also be applied to a group homomorphism $f: G \longrightarrow G'$ . In this case the induced homomorphism of Lie algebras $L(f):L(G) \longrightarrow L(G')$ is returned.

 If the quotients of the lower central series are not all free or p-elementary
abelian then the function returns fail.

 This function was written by Pablo Fernandez Ascariz \\
 \index{TensorWithIntegers} \texttt{TensorWithIntegers(X) } 

 Inputs either a $ZG$-resolution $X=R$, or an equivariant chain map $X = (F:R \longrightarrow S)$. It returns the chain complex or chain map obtained by tensoring with the
trivial module of integers (characteristic 0). \\
 \index{FilteredTensorWithIntegers} \texttt{FilteredTensorWithIntegers(R) } 

 Inputs a $ZG$-resolution $R$ for which "filteredDimension" lies in NamesOfComponents(R). (Such a resolution
can be produced using TwisterTensorProduct(), ResolutionNormalSubgroups() or
FreeGResolution().) It returns the filtered chain complex obtained by
tensoring with the trivial module of integers (characteristic 0). \\
 \index{TensorWithTwistedIntegers} \texttt{TensorWithTwistedIntegers(X,rho) } 

 Inputs either a $ZG$-resolution $X=R$, or an equivariant chain map $X = (F:R \longrightarrow S)$. It also inputs a function $rho\colon G\rightarrow \mathbb Z$ where the action of $g \in G$ on $\mathbb Z$ is such that $g.1 = rho(g)$. It returns the chain complex or chain map obtained by tensoring with the
(twisted) module of integers (characteristic 0). \\
 \index{TensorWithIntegersModP} \texttt{TensorWithIntegersModP(X,p) }

 A $G$-cocomplex $C$ can also be input. The cohomology groups of such a complex may not be abelian. \textsc{Warning:} in this case Cohomology(C,n) returns the abelian invariants of the $n$-th cohomology group of $C$. \\
 \index{CohomologyModule} \texttt{CohomologyModule(C,n) } 

 Inputs a $G$-cocomplex $C$ together with a non-negative integer $n$. It returns the cohomology $H^n(C)$ as a $G$-outer group. If $C$ was constructed from a resolution $R$ by homing to an abelian $G$-outer group $A$ then, for each x in H:=CohomologyModule(C,n), there is a function
f:=H!.representativeCocycle(x) which is a standard n-cocycle corresponding to
the cohomology class x. (At present this works only for n=1,2,3.) \\
 \index{CohomologyPrimePart} \texttt{CohomologyPrimePart(C,n,p)} 

 Inputs a cochain complex $C$ in characteristic 0, a positive integer $n$, and a prime $p$. It returns a list of those torsion coefficients of $H^n(C)$ that are positive powers of $p$. The function uses the EDIM package by Frank Luebeck. \\

 There is an optional third argument which, when set equal to a prime $p$, causes the function to return the the mod $p$ cohomology $H^n(G,Z_p)$ as a list of length equal to its rank. 

 This function is a composite of more basic functions, and makes choices for a

 Inputs a positive integer $n$ and a decreasing chain $S=[S_1, S_2, ..., S_k]$ of normal subgroups in a finite $p$-group $G=S_1$. It returns the bar code of the persistent mod $p$ homology in degree $n$ of the sequence of quotient homomorphisms $G \rightarrow G/S_k \rightarrow G/S_{k-1} \rightarrow ... \rightarrow G/S_2 $. The bar code is returned as a matrix containing the dimensions of the images
of the induced homology maps. 

 If one sets $p=0$ then the integral persitent homology bar code is returned. This is a matrix
whose entries are pairs of the lists: the list of abelian invariants of the
images of the induced homology maps and the cokernels of the induced homology
maps. (The matrix probably does not uniquely determine the induced homology
maps.) 

 Non prime-power (and possibly infinite) groups $G$ can also be handled; in this case the prime must be entered as a third
argument, and the resolution algorithm (e.g. ResolutionNilpotentGroup) can be
entered as a fourth argument. (The default algorithm is ResolutionFiniteGroup,
so this must be changed for infinite groups.) \\
 \index{PersistentCohomologyOfQuotientGroupSeries} \texttt{PersistentCohomologyOfQuotientGroupSeries(S,n)} \texttt{PersistentCohomologyOfQuotientGroupSeries(S,n,p,Resolution{\textunderscore}Algorithm)} 

 Inputs a positive integer $n$ and a decreasing chain $S=[S_1, S_2, ..., S_k]$ of normal subgroups in a finite $p$-group $G=S_1$. It returns the bar code of the persistent mod $p$ cohomology in degree $n$ of the sequence of quotient homomorphisms $G \rightarrow G/S_k \rightarrow G/S_{k-1} \rightarrow ... \rightarrow G/S_2 $. The bar code is returned as a matrix containing the dimensions of the images
of the induced homology maps. 

 If one sets $p=0$ then the integral persitent cohomology bar code is returned. This is a matrix

cohomology maps. (The matrix probably does not uniquely determine the induced

 Non prime-power (and possibly infinite) groups $G$ can also be handled; in this case the prime must be entered as a third
argument, and the resolution algorithm (e.g. ResolutionNilpotentGroup) can be
entered as a fourth argument. (The default algorithm is ResolutionFiniteGroup,
so this must be changed for infinite groups.) 

 (The implementation is possibly a little less efficient than that of the
corresponding persistent homology function.) \\
 \index{UniversalBarCode} \texttt{UniversalBarCode("UpperCentralSeries",n,d)} \texttt{UniversalBarCode("UpperCentralSeries",n,d,k)} 

 Inputs integers $n,d$ that identify a prime power group G=SmallGroup(n,d), together with one of the
strings "UpperCentralSeries", LowerCentralSeries", "DerivedSeries",
"UpperPCentralSeries", "LowerPCentralSeries". The function returns a matrix of
rational functions; the coefficients of $x^k$ in their expansions yield the persistence matrix for the degree $k$ homology with trivial mod p coefficients associated to the quotients of $G$ by the terms of the given series. 

 If the additional integer argument $k$ is supplied then the function returns the degree k homology persistence
matrix. \\
 \index{PersistentHomologyOfSubGroupSeries} \texttt{PersistentHomologyOfSubGroupSeries(S,n)} \texttt{PersistentHomologyOfSubGroupSeries(S,n,p,Resolution{\textunderscore}Algorithm)}

It returns the bar code of the persistent mod $p$ homology in degree $n$ of the sequence of inclusion homomorphisms $S_k \rightarrow S_{k-1} \rightarrow ... \rightarrow S_1=G $. The bar code is returned as a binary matrix. 

 Non prime-power (and possibly infinite) groups $G$ can also be handled; in this case the prime must be entered as a third
argument, and the resolution algorithm (e.g. ResolutionNilpotentGroup) must be
entered as a fourth argument. \\
 \index{PersistentHomologyOfFilteredChainComplex} \texttt{PersistentHomologyOfFilteredChainComplex(C,n,p) } 

 Inputs a filtered chain complex $C$ (of characteristic $0$ or $p$) together with a positive integer $n$ and prime $p$. It returns the bar code of the persistent mod $p$ homology in degree $n$ of the filtered chain complex $C$. (This function needs a more efficient implementation. Its fine as it stands
for investigation in group homology, but not sufficiently efficient for the
homology of large complexes arising in applied topology.) \\
 \texttt{PersistentHomologyOfCommutativeDiagramOfPGroups(D,n) } 

 Inputs a commutative diagram $D$ of finite $p$-groups and a positive integer $n$. It returns a list containing, for each homomorphism in the nerve of $D$, a triple $[k,l,m]$ where $k$ is the dimension of the source of the induced mod $p$ homology map in degree $n$, $l$ is the dimension of the image, and $m$ is the dimension of the cokernel. \\
 \index{PersistentHomologyOfFilteredCubicalComplex} \texttt{PersistentHomologyOfFilteredCubicalComplex(M,n)} 

 Inputs a filtered pure cubical complex $M$ and a non-negative integer $n$. It returns the degree $n$ persistent homology of $ M$ with rational coefficients. \\
 \index{PersistentHomologyOfPureCubicalComplex} \texttt{PersistentHomologyOfPureCubicalComplex(L,n,p)} 

 Inputs a positive integer $n$, a prime $p$ and an increasing chain $L=[L_1, L_2, ..., L_k]$ of subcomplexes in a pure cubical complex $L_k$. It returns the bar code of the persistent mod $p$ homology in degree $n$ of the sequence of inclusion maps. The bar code is returned as a matrix. (This
function is extremely inefficient and it is better to use
PersistentHomologyOFilteredfPureCubicalComplex. 

 \\
 \index{ZZPersistentHomologyOfPureCubicalComplex} \texttt{ZZPersistentHomologyOfPureCubicalComplex(L,n,p)} 

 Inputs a positive integer $n$, a prime $p$ and any sequence $L=[L_1, L_2, ..., L_k]$ of subcomplexes of some pure cubical complex. It returns the bar code of the
zig-zag persistent mod $p$ homology in degree $n$ of the sequence of maps $L_1 \rightarrow L_1 \cup L_2 \leftarrow L_2 \rightarrow L_2 \cup L_3
\leftarrow L_4 \rightarrow ... \leftarrow L_k$. The bar code is returned as a matrix. 

 \\
 \index{RipsHomology} \texttt{RipsHomology(G,n)} \texttt{RipsHomology(G,n,p)} 

 Inputs a graph $G$, a non-negative integer $n$ (and optionally a prime number $p$). It returns the integral homology (or mod p homology) in degree $n$ of the Rips complex of $G$. \\
 \index{BarCode} \texttt{BarCode(P)}

form of a binary matrix (corresponding to the usual bar code). \\

 Inputs an integer persistence matrix P, and an optional string specifying a
viewer/browser. It displays a picture of the bar code (using GraphViz
software). The compact display is better for large bar codes. \\
 \index{Homology} \texttt{Homology(X,n)} 

 Inputs either a chain complex $X=C$ or a chain map $X=(C \longrightarrow D)$. 
\begin{itemize}
\item If $X=C$ then the torsion coefficients of $H_n(C)$ are retuned.
\item  If $X=(C \longrightarrow D)$ then the induced homomorphism $H_n(C) \longrightarrow H_n(D)$ is returned as a homomorphism of finitely presented groups. 
\end{itemize}
 A $G$-complex $C$ can also be input. The homology groups of such a complex may not be abelian. \textsc{Warning:} in this case Homology(C,n) returns the abelian invariants of the $n$-th homology group of $C$. \\
 \index{HomologyPb} \texttt{HomologyPb(C,n)} 

 This is a back-up function which might work in some instances where $Homology(C,n)$ fails. It is most useful for chain complexes whose boundary homomorphisms are
sparse. 

 It inputs a chain complex $C$ in characteristic $0$ and returns the torsion coefficients of $H_n(C)$ . There is a small probability that an incorrect answer could be returned. The
computation relies on probabilistic Smith Normal Form algorithms implemented
in the Simplicial Homology GAP package. This package therefore needs to be
loaded. The computation is stored as a component of $C$ so, when called a second time for a given $C$ and $n$, the calculation is recalled without rerunning the algorithm. 

 The choice of probabalistic algorithm can be changed using the command 

 SetHomologyAlgorithm(HomologyAlgorithm[i]);

 where i = 1,2,3 or 4. The upper limit for the probability of an incorrect
answer can be set to any rational number $0${\textless}$e${\textless}= $1$ using the following command. 

SetUncertaintyTolerence(e);

 See the Simplicial Homology package manual for further details. \\
 \index{HomologyVectorSpace} \texttt{HomologyVectorSpace(X,n)} 

 Inputs either a chain complex $X=C$ or a chain map $X=(C \longrightarrow D)$ in prime characteristic. 
\begin{itemize}
\item If $X=C$ then $H_n(C)$ is retuned as a vector space.
\item  If $X=(C \longrightarrow D)$ then the induced homomorphism $H_n(C) \longrightarrow H_n(D)$ is returned as a homomorphism of vector spaces. 
\end{itemize}
 \\
 \index{HomologyPrimePart} \texttt{HomologyPrimePart(C,n,p)} 

 Inputs a chain complex $C$ in characteristic 0, a positive integer $n$, and a prime $p$. It returns a list of those torsion coefficients of $H_n(C)$ that are positive powers of $p$. The function uses the EDIM GAP package by Frank Luebeck. \\
 \index{LeibnizAlgebraHomology} \texttt{LeibnizAlgebraHomology(A,n)} 

 Inputs a Lie or Leibniz algebra $X=A$ (over the ring of integers $Z$ or over a field $K$), together with a positive integer $n$. It returns the $n$-dimensional Leibniz homology of $A$. \\

 Inputs a Lie algebra $A$ (over the integers or a field) and a positive integer $n$. It returns the homology $H_n(A,k)$ where $k$ denotes the ground ring. \\

 Inputs a finite group $G$, a positive integer $n$, at least $n+1$ terms of a $ZP$-resolution for a Sylow subgroup $P${\textless}$G$ and a "mathematically suitable" covariant additive functor $F$ such as TensorWithIntegers . It returns the abelian invariants of the $p$-component of the homology $H_n(F(R))$ . 

 Warning: All calculations are assumed to be in characteristic 0. The function
should not be used if the coefficient module is over the field of $p$ elements. 

 "Mathematically suitable" means that the Cartan-Eilenberg double coset formula
must hold. \\
 \index{RankHomologyPGroup} \texttt{RankHomologyPGroup(G,n)} \texttt{RankHomologyPGroup(R,n)} \texttt{RankHomologyPGroup(G,n,"empirical")} 

 Inputs a (smallish) $p$-group $G$, or $n$ terms of a minimal $Z_pG$-resolution $R$ of $Z_p$ , together with a positive integer $n$. It returns the minimal number of generators of the integral homology group $H_n(G,Z)$. 

 If an option third string argument "empirical" is included then an empirical
algorithm will be used. This is one which always seems to yield the right
answer but which we can't prove yields the correct answer. \\
 \index{RankPrimeHomology} \texttt{RankPrimeHomology(G,n)} 

 Inputs a (smallish) $p$-group $G$ together with a positive integer $n$. It returns a function $dim(k)$ which gives the rank of the vector space $H_k(G,Z_p)$ for all $0$ {\textless}= $k$ {\textless}= $n$. \\

It returns a quotient of polynomials $f(x)=P(x)/Q(x)$ whose coefficient of $x^k$ equals the rank of the vector space $H_k(G,Z_p)$ for all $k$ in the range $k=1$ to $k=n$. (The second input variable can be omitted, in which case the function tries
to choose a "reasonable" value for $n$. For $2$-groups the function PoincareSeriesLHS(G) can be used to produce an $f(x)$ that is correct in all degrees.) 

 In place of the group $G$ the function can also input (at least $n$ terms of) a minimal mod $p$ resolution $R$ for $G$. 

 Alternatively, the first input variable can be a list $L$ of integers. In this case the coefficient of $x^k$ in $f(x)$ is equal to the $(k+1)$st term in the list. \\

 Inputs either a $p$-group $G$ and positive integer $n$, or else $n$ terms of a minimal $Z_pG$-resolution $R$ of $Z_p$. It returns a pair whose first entry is a minimal set of homogeneous
generators for the cohomology ring $A=H^*(G,Z_p)$ modulo all elements in degree greater than $n$. The second entry of the pair is a function $deg$ which, when applied to a minimal generator, yields its degree. 

 WARNING: the following rule must be applied when multiplying generators $x_i$ together. Only products of the form $x_1*(x_2*(x_3*(x_4*...)))$ with $deg(x_i) \le deg(x_{i+1})$ should be computed (since the $x_i$ belong to a structure constant algebra with only a partially defined structure
constants table). \\

 Inputs either a $p$-group $G$ and positive integer $n$, or else $n$ terms of a minimal $Z_pG$-resolution $R$ of $Z_p$. It returns the cohomology ring $A=H^*(G,Z_p)$ modulo all elements in degree greater than $n$. 

 The ring is returned as a structure constant algebra $A$. 

 The ring $A$ is graded. It has a component $A!.degree(x)$ which is a function returning the degree of each (homogeneous) element $x$ in $GeneratorsOfAlgebra(A)$. 

 An optional input variable "level" can be set to one of the strings "medium"
or "high". These settings determine parameters in the algorithm. The default
setting is "medium". 

 When "level" is set to "high" the ring $A$ is returned with a component $A!.niceBasis$. This component is a pair $[Coeff,Bas]$. Here $Bas$ is a list of integer lists; a "nice" basis for the vector space $A$ can be constructed using the command $List(Bas,x->Product(List(x,i->Basis(A)[i]))$. The coefficients of the canonical basis element $Basis(A)[i]$ are stored as $Coeff[i]$. 

 If the ring $A$ is computed using the setting "level"="medium" then the component $A!.niceBasis$ can be added to $A$ using the command $ A:=ModPCohomologyRing_part_2(A) $. \\
 \index{ModPRingGenerators} \texttt{ModPRingGenerators(A) } 

 Inputs a mod $p$ cohomology ring $A$ (created using the preceeding function). It returns a minimal generating set
for the ring $A$. Each generator is homogeneous. \\
 \texttt{Mod2CohomologyRingPresentation(G) } \texttt{Mod2CohomologyRingPresentation(G,n) } \texttt{Mod2CohomologyRingPresentation(A) } \texttt{Mod2CohomologyRingPresentation(R)} 

 When applied to a finite $2$-group $G$ this function returns a presentation for the mod 2 cohomology ring $H^*(G,Z_2)$. The Lyndon-Hochschild-Serre spectral sequence is used to prove that the
presentation is correct. 

 When the function is applied to a $2$-group $G$ and positive integer $n$ the function first constructs $n$ terms of a free $Z_2G$-resolution $R$, then constructs the finite-dimensional graded algebra $A=H^(*\le n)(G,Z_2)$, and finally uses $A$ to approximate a presentation for $H^*(G,Z_2)$. For "sufficiently large" the approximation will be a correct presentation
for $H^*(G,Z_2)$. 

 Alternatively, the function can be applied directly to either the resolution $R$ or graded algebra $A$. 

This function was written by \textsc{Paul Smith}. It uses the Singular commutative algebra package to handle the
Lyndon-Hochschild-Serre spectral sequence. \\

 Inputs a nilpotent group $G$ and integer $c${\textgreater}$0$. It returns the Baer invariant $M^(c)(G)$ defined as follows. For an arbitrary group $G$ let $L^*_{c+1}(G)$ be the $(c+1)$-st term of the upper central series of the group $U=F/[[[R,F],F]...]$ (with $c$ copies of $F$ in the denominator) where $F/R$ is any free presentation of $G$. This is an invariant of $G$ and we define $M^{(c)}(G)$ to be the kernel of the canonical homomorphism $M^{(c)}(G) \longrightarrow G$. For $c=1$ the Baer invariant $M^(1)(G)$ is isomorphic to the second integral homology $H_2(G,Z)$. 

 This function requires the NQ package. \\

 \texttt{BogomolovMultiplier(G, "standard") } \texttt{BogomolovMultiplier(G, "homology") } \texttt{BogomolovMultiplier(G, "tensor") } 

 Inputs a finite group $G$ and returns the quotient $H_2(G,Z)/K(G)$ of the second integral homology of $G$ where $K(G)$ is the subgroup of $H_2(G,Z)$ generated by the images of all homomorphisms $H_2(A,Z) \rightarrow H_2(G,Z)$ induced from abelian subgroups of $G$. 

 Three slight variants of the implementation are available. The defaults
"standard" implementation seems to work best on average. But for some groups
the "homology" implementation or the "tensor" implementation will be faster.
The variants are called by including the appropriate string as the second
argument. \\
 \index{Bogomology} \texttt{Bogomology(G,n) }

 \index{EpiCentre} \texttt{EpiCentre(G,N) } \texttt{EpiCentre(G)} 

 Inputs a finite group $G$ and normal subgroup $N$ and returns a subgroup $Z^\ast(G,N)$ of the centre of $N$. The group $Z^\ast(G,N)$ is trivial if and only if there is a crossed module $d:E \longrightarrow G$ with $N=Image(d)$ and with $Ker(d)$ equal to the subgroup of $E$ consisting of those elements on which $G$ acts trivially. 

 If no value for $N$ is entered then it is assumed that $N=G$. In this case the group $Z^\ast(G,G)$ is trivial if and only if $G$ is isomorphic to a quotient $G=E/Z(E)$ of some group $E$ by the centre of $E$. (See also the command $UpperEpicentralSeries(G,c)$. ) \\

 Inputs a finite group $G$ and normal subgroup $N$. It returns a record $E$ with the following components. 
\begin{itemize}
\item  $E.homomorphism$ is a group homomorphism ${\ensuremath{\mu}} : (G \wedge N) \longrightarrow G$ from the nonabelian exterior product $(G \wedge N)$ to $G$. The kernel of ${\ensuremath{\mu}}$ is the relative Schur multiplier.

 This function should work for reasonably small nilpotent groups or extremely
small non-nilpotent groups. \\
 \index{NonabelianSymmetricKernel} \texttt{NonabelianSymmetricKernel(G) } \texttt{NonabelianSymmetricKernel(G,m) } 

 Inputs a finite or nilpotent infinite group $G$ and returns the abelian invariants of the Fourth homotopy group $SG$ of the double suspension $SSK(G,1)$ of the Eilenberg-Mac Lane space $K(G,1)$. 

 For non-nilpotent groups the implementation of the function $NonabelianSymmetricKernel(G)$ is far from optimal and will soon be improved. As a temporary solution to this
problem, an optional second variable $m$ can be set equal to $0$, and then the function efficiently returns the abelian invariants of groups $A$ and $B$ such that there is an exact sequence $0 \longrightarrow B \longrightarrow SG \longrightarrow A \longrightarrow 0$. 

 Alternatively, the optional second varible $m$ can be set equal to a positive multiple of the order of the symmetric square $(G \tilde\otimes G)$. In this case the function returns the abelian invariants of $SG$. This might help when $G$ is solvable but not nilpotent (especially if the estimated upper bound $m$ is reasonable accurate). \\

 Inputs a finite or nilpotent infinite group $G$ and returns a record $T$ with the following components. 
\begin{itemize}
\item  $T.homomorphism$ is a group homomorphism ${\ensuremath{\mu}} : (G \tilde\otimes G) \longrightarrow G$ from the nonabelian symmetric square of $G$ to $G$. The kernel of ${\ensuremath{\mu}}$ is isomorphic to the fourth homotopy group of the double suspension $SSK(G,1)$ of an Eilenberg-Mac Lane space. 
\item  $T.pairing(x,y)$ is a function which inputs two elements $x, y$ in $G$ and returns the tensor $(x \otimes y)$ in the symmetric square $(G \otimes G)$ . 
\end{itemize}
 An optional second varible $m$ can be set equal to a multiple of the order of the symmetric square $(G \tilde\otimes G)$. This might help when $G$ is solvable but not nilpotent (especially if the estimated upper bound $m$ is reasonable accurate) as the bound is used in the solvable quotient
algorithm. 

 The optional second variable $m$ can also be set equal to $0$. In this case the Todd-Coxeter procedure will be used to enumerate the
symmetric square even when $G$ is solvable. 

 This function should work for reasonably small solvable groups or extremely
small non-solvable groups. \\

square even when $G$ is solvable.

 \index{RelativeSchurMultiplier} \texttt{RelativeSchurMultiplier(G,N) } 

 Inputs a finite group $G$ and normal subgroup $N$. It returns the homology group $H_2(G,N,Z)$ that fits into the exact sequence 

 $\ldots\longrightarrow H_3(G,Z) \longrightarrow H_3(G/N,Z) \longrightarrow
H_2(G,N,Z) \longrightarrow H_3(G,Z) \longrightarrow H_3(G/N,Z) \longrightarrow

 Inputs a group $G$ and returns the largest central subgroup $N$ such that the induced homomorphism of nonabelian tensor squares $(G \otimes G) \longrightarrow (G/N \otimes G/N)$ is an isomorphism. Equivalently, $N$ is the largest central subgroup such that $\pi_3(SK(G,1)) \longrightarrow \pi_3(SK(G/N,1))$ is injective. \\
 \index{ThirdHomotopyGroupOfSuspensionB} \texttt{ThirdHomotopyGroupOfSuspensionB(G) } \texttt{ThirdHomotopyGroupOfSuspensionB(G,m) } 

 Inputs a finite or nilpotent infinite group $G$ and returns the abelian invariants of the third homotopy group $JG$ of the suspension $SK(G,1)$ of the Eilenberg-Mac Lane space $K(G,1)$. 

 For non-nilpotent groups the implementation of the function $ThirdHomotopyGroupOfSuspensionB(G)$ is far from optimal and will soon be improved. As a temporary solution to this
problem, an optional second variable $m$ can be set equal to $0$, and then the function efficiently returns the abelian invariants of groups $A$ and $B$ such that there is an exact sequence $0 \longrightarrow B \longrightarrow JG \longrightarrow A \longrightarrow 0$. 

 Alternatively, the optional second varible $m$ can be set equal to a positive multiple of the order of the tensor square $(G \otimes G)$. In this case the function returns the abelian invariants of $JG$. This might help when $G$ is solvable but not nilpotent (especially if the estimated upper bound $m$ is reasonable accurate). \\

 The upper epicentral series is defined for an arbitrary group $G$. The group $Z_c^\ast (G)$ is the image in $G$ of the $c$-th term $Z_c(U)$ of the upper central series of the group $U=F/[[[R,F],F] \ldots ]$ (with $c$ copies of $F$ in the denominator) where $F/R$ is any free presentation of $G$.

Mozilla web browser as a default to view the diagram. An alternative browser
can be set using a second argument. 

 The argument $G$ can also be a finite set of elements in a (possibly infinite) group containing $X$. The edges of the graph are coloured according to which element of $X$ they are labelled by. The list $X$ corresponds to the list of colours [blue, red, green, yellow, brown, black] in

Currently the function only applies to certain crystallographic groups. See

the orbit of $v$ under the action of $G$. The cellular chain complex $C_*=C_*(P(G,v))$ is an exact sequence of (not necessarily free) $ZG$-modules. The function returns a component object $R$ with components:

\item  $R!.dimension(k)$ is a function which returns the number of $G$-orbits of the $k$-dimensional faces in $P(G,v)$. If each $k$-face has trivial stabilizer subgroup in $G$ then $C_k$ is a free $ZG$-module of rank $R.dimension(k)$. 
\item  $R!.stabilizer(k,n)$ is a function which returns the stabilizer subgroup for a face in the $n$-th orbit of $k$-faces. 
\item  If all faces of dimension {\textless}$k+1$ have trivial stabilizer group then the first $k$ terms of $C_*$ constitute part of a free $ZG$-resolution. The boundary map is described by the function $boundary(k,n)$ . (If some faces have non-trivial stabilizer group then $C_*$ is not free and no attempt is made to determine signs for the boundary map.) 
\item  $R!.elements$, $R!.group$, $R!.properties$ are as in a $ZG$-resolution. 
\end{itemize}
 If an optional third input variable $n$ is used, then only the first $n$ terms of the resolution $C_*$ will be computed. 

 The function uses Polymake software. \\
 \index{PolytopalGenerators} \texttt{PolytopalGenerators(G,v) } 

 Inputs a permutation group or matrix group $G$ of degree $n$ and a rational vector $v$ of length $n$. In both cases there is a natural action of $G$ on $v$, and the vector $v$ must be chosen so that it has trivial stabilizer subgroup in $G$. Let $P(G,v)$ be the convex polytope arising as the convex hull of the Euclidean points in
the orbit of $v$ under the action of $G$. The function returns a record $P$ with components: 
\begin{itemize}
\item  $P.generators$ is a list of all those elements $g$ in $G$ such that $g\cdot v$ has an edge in common with $v$. The list is a generating set for $G$.
\item  $P.vector$ is the vector $v$.
\item $P.hasseDiagram$ is the Hasse diagram of the cone at $v$. 
\end{itemize}
 The function uses Polymake software. The function is joint work with Seamus
Kelly. \\
 \index{VectorStabilizer} \texttt{VectorStabilizer(G,v) } 

 Inputs a permutation group or matrix group $G$ of degree $n$ and a rational vector of degree $n$. In both cases there is a natural action of $G$ on $v$ and the function returns the group of elements in $G$ that fix $v$. \\

 \index{ChildReadEval} \texttt{ChildReadEval(s)} 

 This returns, as an evaluated string, the output of the last application of $ChildFunction("function(arg);",s)$. \\
 \index{ParallelList} \texttt{ParallelList(I,fn,L)} 

 Inputs a list $I$, a function $fn$ such that $fn(x)$ is defined for all $x$ in $I$, and a list of children $L$. It uses the children in $L$ to compute $List(I,x->fn(x))$. (Obviously the function $fn$ must be defined on all child processes in $L$.) \\

\begin{tabular}{|l|} \index{BoundaryMap} \texttt{BoundaryMap(C)} 

 Inputs a resolution, chain complex or cochain complex $C$ and returns the function $C!.boundary$. \\
 \index{BoundaryMatrix} \texttt{BoundaryMatrix(C,n)} 

 Inputs a chain or cochain complex $C$ and integer $n${\textgreater}$0$. It returns the $n$-th boundary map of $C$ as a matrix. \\
 \index{Dimension} \texttt{Dimension(C) } \\
 \texttt{Dimension(M) } 

 Inputs a resolution, chain complex or cochain complex $C$ and returns the function $C!.dimension$ . 

 Alternatively, inputs an $FpG$-module $M$ and returns its dimension as a vector space over the field of $p$ elements. \\
 \index{EvaluateProperty} \texttt{EvaluateProperty(X,"name") } 

 Inputs a component object $X$ (such as a $ZG$-resolution or chain map) and a string "name" (such as "characteristic" or
"type"). It searches $X.property$ for the pair ["name",value] and returns value. If $X.property$ does not exist, or if ["name",value] does not exist, it returns fail. \\
 \index{GroupOfResolution} \texttt{GroupOfResolution(R)} 

 Inputs a $ZG$-resolution $R$ and returns the group $G$. \\
 \index{Length} \texttt{Length(R)} 

 Inputs a resolution $R$ and returns its length (i.e. the number of terms of $R$ that HAP has computed). \\
 \index{Map} \texttt{Map(f)} 

 Inputs a chain map, or cochain map or equivariant chain map $f$ and returns the mapping function (as opposed to the target or the source of $f$) . \\
 \index{Source} \texttt{Source(f)} 

 Inputs a chain map, or cochain map, or equivariant chain map, or $FpG$-module homomorphism $f$ and returns it source. \\
 \index{Target} \texttt{Target(f)} 

 Inputs a chain map, or cochain map, or equivariant chain map, or $FpG$-module homomorphism $f$ and returns its target. \\

\begin{tabular}{|l|} \index{SL2Z} \texttt{SL2Z(p) } \texttt{SL2Z(1/m) } 

 Inputs a prime $p$ or the reciprocal $1/m$ of a square free integer $m$. In the first case the function returns the conjugate $SL(2,Z)^P$ of the special linear group $SL(2,Z)$ by the matrix $P=[[1,0],[0,p]]$. In the second case it returns the group $SL(2,Z[1/m])$. \\
 \index{BigStepLCS} \texttt{BigStepLCS(G,n) } 

 Inputs a group $G$ and a positive integer $n$. It returns a subseries $G=L_1${\textgreater}$L_2${\textgreater}$ \ldots L_k=1$ of the lower central series of $G$ such that $L_i/L_{i+1}$ has order greater than $n$. \\
 \index{Classify} \texttt{Classify(L,Inv) } 

 Inputs a list of objects $L$ and a function $Inv$ which computes an invariant of each object. It returns a list of lists which
classifies the objects of $L$ according to the invariant.. \\
 \index{RefineClassification} \texttt{RefineClassification(C,Inv) } 

 Inputs a list $C:=Classify(L,OldInv)$ and returns a refined classification according to the invariant $Inv$. \\
 \index{Compose(f,g)} \texttt{Compose(f,g) } 

 Inputs two $FpG$-module homomorphisms $ f:M \longrightarrow N$ and $g:L \longrightarrow M$ with $Source(f)=Target(g)$ . It returns the composite homomorphism $fg:L \longrightarrow N$ . 

 This also applies to group homomorphisms $f,g$. \\
 \index{HAPcopyright} \texttt{HAPcopyright() } 

 This function provides details of HAP'S GNU public copyright licence. \\
 \index{IsLieAlgebraHomomorphism} \texttt{IsLieAlgebraHomomorphism(f) } 

 Inputs an object $f$ and returns true if $f$ is a homomorphism $f:A \longrightarrow B$ of Lie algebras (preserving the Lie bracket). \\
 \index{IsSuperperfect} \texttt{IsSuperperfect(G) } 

 Inputs a group $G$ and returns "true" if both the first and second integral homology of $G$ is trivial. Otherwise, it returns "false". \\
 \index{MakeHAPManual} \texttt{MakeHAPManual()} 

 This function creates the manual for HAP from an XML file. \\
 \index{PermToMatrixGroup} \texttt{PermToMatrixGroup(G,n) } 

 Inputs a permutation group $G$ and its degree $n$. Returns a bijective homomorphism $f:G \longrightarrow M$ where $M$ is a group of permutation matrices. \\
 \index{SolutionsMatDestructive} \texttt{SolutionsMatDestructive(M,B) } 

 Inputs an $m{\ensuremath{\times}}n$ matrix $M$ and a $k{\ensuremath{\times}}n$ matrix $B$ over a field. It returns a k{\ensuremath{\times}}m matrix $S$ satisfying $SM=B$. 

 The function will leave matrix $M$ unchanged but will probably change matrix $B$. 

 (This is a trivial rewrite of the standard GAP function $SolutionMatDestructive(${\textless}$mat${\textgreater},{\textless}$vec${\textgreater}) .) \\
 \index{LinearHomomorphismsPersistenceMat} \texttt{LinearHomomorphismsPersistenceMat(L) } 

 Inputs a composable sequence $L$ of vector space homomorphisms. It returns an integer matrix containing the
dimensions of the images of the various composites. The sequence $L$ is determined up to isomorphism by this matrix. \\
 \index{NormalSeriesToQuotientHomomorphisms} \texttt{NormalSeriesToQuotientHomomorphisms(L) } 

 Inputs an (increasing or decreasing) chain $L$ of normal subgroups in some group $G$. This $G$ is the largest group in the chain. It returns the sequence of composable group
homomorphisms $G/L[i] \rightarrow G/L[i+/-1]$. \\
 \index{TestHap} \texttt{TestHap() } 

 This runs a representative sample of HAP functions and checks to see that they
produce the correct output. \\
