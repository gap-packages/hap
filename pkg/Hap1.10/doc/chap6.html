<p>Inputs a G-cocomplex C together with a non-negative integer n. It returns the cohomology H^n(C) as a G-outer group. If C was constructed from a resolution R by homing to an abelian G-outer group A then, for each x in H:=CohomologyModule(C,n), there is a function f:=H!.representativeCocycle(x) which is a standard n-cocycle corresponding to the cohomology class x. (At present this works only for n=1,2,3.)</td>

Its fine as it stands for investigation in group homology, but not sufficiently efficient for the homology of large complexes arising in applied topology.)</td>

<td class="tdleft"><code class="code">HomologyPb(C,n)</code></p>

<p>This is a back-up function which might work in some instances where Homology(C,n) fails. It is most useful for chain complexes whose boundary homomorphisms are sparse.</p>

<p>It inputs a chain complex C in characteristic 0 and returns the torsion coefficients of H_n(C) . There is a small probability that an incorrect answer could be returned. The computation relies on probabilistic Smith Normal Form algorithms implemented in the Simplicial Homology GAP package. This package therefore needs to be loaded. The computation is stored as a component of C so, when called a second time for a given C and n, the calculation is recalled without rerunning the algorithm.</p>

<p>The choice of probabalistic algorithm can be changed using the command</p>

<p>SetHomologyAlgorithm(HomologyAlgorithm[i]);</p>

<p>where i = 1,2,3 or 4. The upper limit for the probability of an incorrect answer can be set to any rational number 0&lt;e&lt;= 1 using the following command.</p>

<p>SetUncertaintyTolerence(e);</p>

<p>Warning: All calculations are assumed to be in characteristic 0. The function should not be used if the coefficient module is over the field of p elements.</p>

<p>If an option third string argument "empirical" is included then an empirical algorithm will be used. This is one which always seems to yield the right answer but which we can't prove yields the correct answer.</td>
