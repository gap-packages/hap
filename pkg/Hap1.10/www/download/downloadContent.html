<h3>Download Instructions</h3>
<p>
On a Linux machine with GAP installed, the HAP library can be loaded as
follows:<br>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>First download the file <a
 href="http://hamilton.nuigalway.ie/Hap/hap1.10.tar.gz">hap1.10.tar.gz</a>
which contains the most recent development version of HAP to the
subdirectory
"pkg/" of GAP. If you don't have access to this subdirectory,
then create a directory "pkg" in your home directory and download the
file there. (if for some reason you'd prefer to download the most
recent non-development version of HAP then download the file&nbsp; <a
 href="http://hamilton.nuigalway.ie/Hap/hap1.10.1.tar.gz">hap1.10.1.tar.gz</a>
instead.)<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Change to directory "pkg/" and type "gunzip
hap1.10.tar.gz"
followed
by "tar
-xvf hap1.10.tar" .</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Start GAP. (If you have created "pkg" in your home
directory then
start GAP with the command "gap -l 'path/homedir;' " &nbsp; where
path/homedir is the path to your home directory.)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>In GAP type " LoadPackage("HAP"); "<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Help on HAP can be found on the <a
 href="http://hamilton.nuigalway.ie/Hap/www/index.html" target="index">HAP
home page</a> (a version of which is included in directory
"pkg/Hap1.10/www" of the distribution).</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>A few of HAP's (optional) functions rely on Polymake
software
(available from www.math.tu-berlin.de/polymake/) which should be
installed so that it
starts using the command "polymake" at the Linux prompt. A few
(optional) functions rely on Graphviz software (available from
http://www.graphviz.org/).<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Performance can be improved by using a compiled
version of the HAP library. The following steps will produce a compiled
version. <br>
(1) Change to the directory "pkg/Hap1.10/" .<br>
(2) Edit the file "compile" so that: PKGDIR is equal to the path to the<br>
directory "pkg" where your GAP packages are stored; GACDIR is equal to
the<br>
path to the directory where the GAP compiler "gac" is stored.<br>
(3) Type "./compile" .<br>
The next time HAP is loaded a compiled version will be loaded.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Should you want to return to an uncompiled version, change
to the directory<br>
"pkg/Hap1.10/" and type "./uncompile".</li>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<h3>Changes Log</h3>
<p>
Version <a href="http://hamilton.nuigalway.ie/Hap/hap1.4.tar.gz">1.4</a>
was released on
03/05/2006.<br>
<br>
Version <a href="http://hamilton.nuigalway.ie/Hap/hap1.5.tar.gz">1.5</a>
was released on
12/06/2006. GAP types were introduced for resolutions, chain complexes
etc. and methods for PrintObj and ViewObj were introduced.&nbsp; The
functions Homology and Cohomology where changed to GAP operations. A
Linux shell script "compile" for creating a GAC compiled version of the
HAP functions was added. The performance of the functions
NonabelianTensorSquare() and ResolutionPrimePowerGroup() was improved.
Functions&nbsp; ResolutionSubnormalSeries(),
ResolutionAlmostCrystalGroup() and ResolutionAlmostCrystalQuotient()
were added.<br>
<br>
Version <a href="http://hamilton.nuigalway.ie/Hap/hap1.6.tar.gz">1.6</a>
was released on
15/08/2006. The functions
Honology(), Cohomology() and PrimePartDerivedFunctor() have been
speeded up.&nbsp; Graphviz is now used to visualize Coxeter
diagrams, Graphs of groups and Cayley graphs. The functions
ResolutionGraphOfGroups(), ChevalleyEilenbergComplex(),
LieAlgebraHomology, LowerCentralSeriesLieAlgebra(),
ModPCohomologyRing(), ModPRingGenerators have been included. <br>
<br>
Version <a href="http://hamilton.nuigalway.ie/Hap/hap1.7.tar.gz">1.7</a>
was released on 01/09/2006.
The functions Epicentre() and
IsGraphOfGroups() were renamed EpiCentre() and GraphofGroupsTest() due
to
name clashes arising from recent modifications to GAP.&nbsp; A minor
modification was made to the functions NonabelianTensorSquare() and
ThirdHomotopyGroupOfSuspensionB() so that they run on nilpotent
infinite groups when the NQ package is loaded.<br>
<br>
Version 1.7.1 was released on 27/11/2006. The function HomologyPB() was
added. This relies on the Simplicial Homology GAP package. It uses
probabilistic methods to compute homology.<br>
<br>
Version <a href="http://hamilton.nuigalway.ie/Hap/hap1.7.3.tar.gz">1.7.3</a>
was released on
7/03/2007. The efficiency of the code
for the function ResolutionPrimePowerGroup() was improved. Also, a bug
in the function&nbsp; ThirdHomotopyGroupSuspensionB() was fixed.<br>
<br>
Version <a href="http://hamilton.nuigalway.ie/Hap/hap1.7.4.tar.gz">1.7.4</a>
was released on
10/04/2007. A bug was fixed in the function NonabelianTensorProduct().
The bug caused incorrect answers. Also, the function PoincareSeries()
was added.<br>
</p>
<p>Version <a href="http://hamilton.nuigalway.ie/Hap/hap1.8.tar.gz">1.8</a>
was released on 16/08/2007. A bug in the function ModPCohomologyRing()
was fixed. The efficiency of the function Prank() was improved. The
efficiency of the function ModPRingGenerators was improved. A
contracting homotopy was added to the output of the function
ResolutionPrimePowerGroup(). Quite a few
additions were made to the list of functions for FpG-modules.&nbsp; The
function RandomHomomorphismOfFpGModules() still gives an incorrect
output! The
function GroupCohomology() was added. The output of
GroupHomology(G,n,p) was changed from an integer to a list (in keeping
with the output from GroupHomology(G,n) ). The manual/web pages were
revamped. <br>
</p>
<p>Version <a href="http://hamilton.nuigalway.ie/Hap/hap1.8.4.tar.gz">1.8.4</a>
includes some functions for parallel computations, and some functions
for Topological Data Analysis.<br>
</p>
<p>Version <a href="http://hamilton.nuigalway.ie/Hap/hap1.8.6.tar.gz">1.8.6</a>
includes some functions for topological data analysis. The function
ModPCohomologyRing() has be speeded up. There is also now a function
for the cover of a (non-nilpotent) Lie algebra.<br>
</p>
<p>Version <a href="http://hamilton.nuigalway.ie/Hap/hap1.8.8.tar.gz">1.8.8</a>
includes the notion of a cocycle with coefficients in a G-module (=
abelian G-outer group group). It contains a function for writing a
resolution to a file. It also contains the beginning of functionality
for handling homological algebra at the abstract level of
abelian categories. <br>
</p>
<p>Version <a href="http://hamilton.nuigalway.ie/Hap/hap1.8.9.tar.gz">1.8.9</a>
replaces many "do it yourself" references to /tmp/temproray_file by a
more robust reference to
Filename(DirectoryTemporary(),"temporary_file"). It fixes a bug&nbsp;
in 1.8.8 involving a declaration of an existing operation. Some
functions for FpG-modules have been added (such as
CompositionSeriesOfFpGModule()).<br>
</p>
<p>Version 1.8.10 didn't really exist! Version 1.8.11 has improved
functions for topological data analysis, including functions for
simplicial and cubical complexes.<br>
</p>
<p>Versions <a href="http://hamilton.nuigalway.ie/Hap/hap1.9.2.tar.gz">1.9.0</a>-<a
 href="http://hamilton.nuigalway.ie/Hap/hap1.9.3.tar.gz">1.9.3</a> have
better functionality for cubical complexes (and in particular a faster
method for finding an acyclic subcomplex of a 3-dimensional cubical
complex). Version 1.9.3 has a working resolution for arithmetic groups
such as PSL(4,Z), PGL(3,Z[i]) and PGL(3,Z[w]) where w is a third root
of unity.<br>
