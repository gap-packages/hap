<Verb>PureComplexBoundary(M):: PurePermComplex --> PurePermComplex</Verb><P/>



<P/> Inputs a <M>d</M>-dimensional pure cubical  or  pure permutahedral complex <M>M</M>
and returns a <M>d</M>-dimensional complex consisting of the closure of those
 <M>d</M>-cells whose boundaries contains some cell with coboundary  of size less than the  maximal possible size.
