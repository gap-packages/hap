<Verb>HomologyOfDerivation(d):: Derivation --> List</Verb><P/>

Inputs a derivation <M>d\colon E \rightarrow E</M> on a quotient
<M>E=R/I</M> of a polynomial ring <M>R=\mathbb F[x_1,\ldots,x_m]</M> over a field 
<M>\mathbb F</M>.  
It returns a list <M>[S,J,h]</M> where <M>S</M> is a polynomial ring and <M>J</M> is a list of generators for an ideal in $S$ such that there is an isomorphism
<M>\alpha\colon S/J \rightarrow \ker d/{\rm im~} d</M>. This isomorphism lifts to the ring homomorphism <M>h\colon S \rightarrow \ker d</M>. 

This function was written by Paul Smith. It uses the Singular commutative algebra package.
