<Verb>FreeGResolution(P,n):: NonFreeResolution, Int --> FreeResolution</Verb><P/> 

Inputs a non-free $\mathbb ZG$-resolution $P_\ast$ and a  positive integer <M>n</M>. 
It attempts to return <M>n</M> terms of a free <M>\mathbb ZG</M>-resolution
of <M>\mathbb Z</M>. However, the stabilizer groups in the non-free resolution must be such that HAP can construct free resolutions with contracting homotopies for them.


<P/>
The contracting homotopy on the resolution was implemented by  Bui Anh Tuan.
