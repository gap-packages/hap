<Verb>ChainComplexEquivalence(X):: RegCWComplex --> List</Verb><P/>

<P/> Inputs a regular CW-complex  <M>X</M> and returns a pair 
<M>[f_\ast, g_\ast]</M> of chain maps <M>f_\ast\colon C_\ast(X) \rightarrow D_\ast(X)</M>, <M>g_\ast\colon D_\ast(X) \rightarrow C_\ast(X)</M>. 
Here <M>C_\ast(X)</M> is the standard cellular chain complex of <M>X</M> with one free generator for each cell in <M>X</M>. The chain complex <M>D_\ast(X)</M>
is a typically smaller chain complex arising from a discrete vector field on <M>X</M>. The chain maps <M>f_\ast, g_\ast</M> are chain homotopy equivalences.
