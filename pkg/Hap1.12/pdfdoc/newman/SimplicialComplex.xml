<Verb>SimplicialComplex(L):: List --> SimplicialComplex</Verb><P/>

<P/>Inputs a list <M>L</M> whose entries are lists of vertices representing the maximal 
simplices of a simplicial complex, and returns 
the simplicial complex. Here a "vertex" is a GAP object such as an integer or 
a subgroup. The list <M>L</M> can also contain  non-maximal simplices.
