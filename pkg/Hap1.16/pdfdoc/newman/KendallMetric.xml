<Verb>KendallMetric(g,h):: Permutation, Permutation --> Int</Verb><P/>

<P/> Inputs two permutations <M>g,h</M> and optionally the degree <M>N</M>
 of a symmetric group containing them. It returns the minimum number of 
adjacent transpositions needed to express <M>g*h^{-1}</M>
 as a product of adjacent transpositions. An {\em adjacent} transposition is
of the form <M>(i,i+1)</M>.
