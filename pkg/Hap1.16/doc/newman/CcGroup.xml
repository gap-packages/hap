<Verb>CcGroup(N,f):: GOuterGroup, StandardCocycle --> CcGroup</Verb><P/>

Inputs a <M>G</M>-outer group <M>N</M> with nonabelian cocycle describing some
 extension <M>N \rightarrowtail E \twoheadrightarrow G</M> together
with  standard 2-cocycle 
<M>f\colon  G \times G \rightarrow A</M> where <M>A=Z(N)</M>. It returns 
the extension group 
determined by the cocycle <M>f</M>. The group is returned as a cocyclic
group.
