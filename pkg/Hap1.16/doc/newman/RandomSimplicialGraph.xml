<Verb>RandomSimplicialGraph(n,p):: Int, Int --> SimplicialComplex</Verb><P/>

<P/> Inputs an integer <M> n \ge 1 </M> and  positive prime <M>p</M>, and 
returns an Erd\"os-R\'enyi random graph as a <M>1</M>-dimensional simplicial complex. The graph has <M>n</M> vertices. Each  pair of vertices is, with probability
<M>p</M>, directly 
connected by an edge.
