      </div>
On a Linux machine with GAP installed, the HAP library can be loaded as
follows:<br>
      <ul>
        <li>First download the file <a href="../hap1.7.4.tar.gz">hap1.7.4.tar.gz</a>
to the subdirectory
"pkg/" of GAP. (If you don't have access to this,
then create a directory "pkg" in your home directory and download the
file there.)</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>Change to directory "pkg/" and type "gunzip
hap1.7.4.tar.gz"
followed
by "tar
-xvf hap1.7.4.tar" .</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>Start GAP. (If you have created "pkg" in your home
directory then
start GAP with the command "gap -l 'path/homedir;' " &nbsp; where
path/homedir is the path to your home directory.)</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>In GAP type " LoadPackage("HAP"); "<br>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>Help on HAP can be found on the <a
 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 102);" href="index.html" target="index">HAP
home page</a> (a version of which is included in directory
"pkg/Hap1.7.4/www" of the distribution).</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>A few of HAP's (optional) functions rely on Polymake
software
(available from www.math.tu-berlin.de/polymake/) which should be
installed so that it
starts using the command "polymake" at the Linux prompt. A few
(optional) functions rely on Graphviz software (available from
http://www.graphviz.org/).<br>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>Performance can be improved by using a compiled
version of the HAP library. The following steps will produce a compiled
version. <br>
(1) Change to the directory "pkg/Hap1.7.4/" .<br>
(2) Edit the file "compile" so that: PKGDIR is equal to the path to the<br>
directory "pkg" where your GAP packages are stored; GACDIR is equal to
the<br>
path to the directory where the GAP compiler "gac" is stored.<br>
(3) Type "./compile" .<br>
The next time HAP is loaded a compiled version will be loaded.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>Should you want to return to an uncompiled version, change
to the directory<br>
"pkg/Hap1.7.4/" and type "./uncompile".</li>
      </ul>

      <div style="text-align: left;"><br>
Version <a href="../hap1.4.tar.gz">1.4</a> was released on
03/05/2006.<br>
      <br>
Version <a href="../hap1.5.tar.gz">1.5</a> was released on
12/06/2006. GAP types were introduced for resolutions, chain complexes
etc. and methods for PrintObj and ViewObj were introduced.&nbsp; The
functions Homology and Cohomology where changed to GAP operations. A
Linux shell script "compile" for creating a GAC compiled version of the
HAP functions was added. The performance of the functions
NonabelianTensorSquare() and ResolutionPrimePowerGroup() was improved.
Functions&nbsp; ResolutionSubnormalSeries(),
ResolutionAlmostCrystalGroup() and ResolutionAlmostCrystalQuotient()
were added.<br>
      <br>
Version <a href="../hap1.6.tar.gz">1.6</a> was released on
15/08/2006. The functions
Honology(), Cohomology() and PrimePartDerivedFunctor() have been
speeded up.&nbsp; Graphviz is now used to visualize Coxeter
diagrams, Graphs of groups and Cayley graphs. The functions
ResolutionGraphOfGroups(), ChevalleyEilenbergComplex(),
LieAlgebraHomology, LowerCentralSeriesLieAlgebra(),
ModPCohomologyRing(), ModPRingGenerators have been included. <br>
      <br>
Version <a href="../hap1.7.tar.gz">1.7</a> was released on 01/09/2006.
The functions Epicentre() and
IsGraphOfGroups() were renamed EpiCentre() and GraphofGroupsTest() due
to
name clashes arising from recent modifications to GAP.&nbsp; A minor
modification was made to the functions NonabelianTensorSquare() and
ThirdHomotopyGroupOfSuspensionB() so that they run on nilpotent
infinite groups when the NQ package is loaded.<br>
      <br>
Version 1.7.1 was released on 27/11/2006. The function HomologyPB() was
added. This relies on the Simplicial Homology GAP package. It uses
probabilistic methods to compute homology.<br>
      <br>
Version <a href="../hap1.7.3.tar.gz">1.7.3</a> was released on
7/03/2007. The efficiency of the code
for the function ResolutionPrimePowerGroup() was improved. Also, a bug
in the function&nbsp; ThirdHomotopyGroupSuspensionB() was fixed.<br>
      <br>
Version <a href="../hap1.7.4.tar.gz">1.7.4</a> was released on
10/04/2007. A bug was fixed in the function NonabelianTensorProduct().
The bug caused incorrect answers. Also, the function PoincareSeries()
was added.<br>
