<Verb>VectorsToSymmetricMatrix(V,d):: List, Function --> Matrix</Verb><P/>

<P/> Inputs a list <M>V =\{ v_1, \ldots, v_k\} \in \mathbb R^n</M> and 
returns the <M>k \times k</M> symmetric matrix  of Euclidean distances 
<M>d(v_i, v_j)</M>. When these distances are irrational they are approximated by a rational number.
 
<P/> As an optional second argument any rational valued function 
<M>d(x,y)</M> can be entered.
