<Verb>CliqueComplex(G,n):: Graph, Int --> SimplicialComplex</Verb>
<Verb>CliqueComplex(F,n):: FilteredGraph, Int --> FilteredSimplicialComplex</Verb>
<Verb>CliqueComplex(K,n):: SimplicialComplex, Int --> SimplicialComplex</Verb><P/>

<P/> Inputs a graph <M>G</M> and integer <M>n \ge 1</M>. It
returns the <M>n</M>-skeleton of a simplicial complex <M>K</M> with
one <M>k</M>-simplex for each complete subgraph of <M>G</M> on <M>k+1</M>
vertices.

<P/> Inputs a fitered graph <M>F</M> and integer <M>n \ge 1</M>. It
returns the <M>n</M>-skeleton of a filtered 
simplicial complex <M>K</M> whose <M>t</M>-term has one 
 <M>k</M>-simplex for each complete subgraph of the <M>t</M>-th term
of <M>G</M> on <M>k+1</M>
vertices.

<P/> Inputs a simplicial complex of dimension <M>d=1</M> or <M>d=2</M>. If
<M>d=1</M> then the clique complex of a graph returned.  If
<M>d=2</M> then the clique complex of a $2$-complex is returned.
