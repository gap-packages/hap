<P/>
Reads a CSV file  identified by a string str such as
"file.pdb" or "path/file.pdb"   
and 
 returns a <M>3</M>-dimensional pure cubical complex <M>K</M>. Each line of the file should contain the coordinates of a point in <M>\mathbb R^3</M> and 
the  
complex <M>K</M> should  represent a  knot determined by the sequence of points, though  the latter is not guaranteed.
 A useful check in this direction is to test that <M>K</M> has the homotopy type of a circle.

<P/>If the test fails then  try the function again with an integer
<M>r \ge 2</M> entered as the optional second argument. The integer determines the resolution with which the knot is constructed. 

<P/> The function can also read in a list <M>L</M> of strings identifying CSV files for several knots. In this case a list <M>R</M> of integer resolutions can also be entered. The lists <M>L</M> and <M>R</M> must be of equal length.
