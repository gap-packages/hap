<Verb>RandomSimplicialTwoComplex(n,p):: Int, Int --> SimplicialComplex</Verb><P/>

<P/> Inputs an integer <M> n \ge 1 </M> and  positive prime <M>p</M>, and 
returns a Linial-Meshulam random simplicial <M>2</M>-complex.
The <M>1</M>-skeleton of this simplicial complex is the complete graph on <M>n</M> vertices. Each triple of vertices lies, with probability <M>p</M>, in a common <M>2</M>-simplex of the complex.
