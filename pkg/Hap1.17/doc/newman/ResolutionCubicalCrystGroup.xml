<Verb>ResolutionCubicalCrustGroup(G,k):: MatrixGroup, Int --> FreeResolution</Verb>


<P/> 
Inputs a crystallographic group <M>G</M> 
 represented using <B>AffineCrystGroupOnRight</B>
 as in the GAP package <M>Cryst</M> together with an integer <M>k \ge 1</M>. 
The function tries to find a cubical fundamental domain in  
  the Euclidean space <M>\mathbb R^n</M> on which <M>G</M>
 acts. If it succeeds it uses this domain to
return   <M>k+1</M> terms of a free ZG-resolution 
of <M>\mathbb Z</M>.
