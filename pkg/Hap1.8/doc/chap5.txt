      | [22m[32m ChevalleyEilenbergComplex(X,n) [0m Inputs either a Lie algebra X=A (over the ring of integers Z or over a field K) or a homomorphism of Lie algebras X=(f:A --> B), together with a positive integer n. It returns either the first n terms of the Chevalley-Eilenberg chain complex C(A), or the induced map of Chevalley-Eilenberg complexes C(f):C(A) --> C(B). (The homology of the Chevalley-Eilenberg complex C(A) is by definition the homology of the Lie algebra A with trivial coefficients in Z or K). This function was written by Pablo Fernandez Ascariz |
