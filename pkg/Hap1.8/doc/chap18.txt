      | [22m[32mChildProcess()[0m [22m[32mChildProcess("computer.ac.wales")[0m This starts a GAP session as a child process and returns a stream to the child process. If no argument is given then the child process is created on the local machine; otherwise the argument should be the address of a remote computer for which ssh has been configured to require no password from the user. (To configure ssh so that the user can login without a password prompt from "thishost" to "remotehost" either consult "man ssh" or - open a shell on thishost - cd .ssh - ls -> if id_dsa, id_rsa etc exists, skip the next two steps! - ssh-keygen -t rsa - ssh-keygen -t dsa - scp *.pub user@remotehost:~/ - ssh remotehost -l user - cat id_rsa.pub >> .ssh/authorized_keys - cat id_dsa.pub >> .ssh/authorized_keys - rm id_rsa.pub id_dsa.pub - exit You should now be able to connect from "thishost" to "remotehost" without a password prompt.) |
