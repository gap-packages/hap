      | [22m[32mChildClose(s)[0m This closes the stream s to a child GAP process.                                                                                                                                  | 
      | [22m[32mChildCommand("cmd;",s)[0m This runs any GAP command "cmd;" on child process accessed by the stream s. No output from "cmd;" can be accessed via the stream.                                        | 
      | [22m[32mChildFunction("function(arg);",s)[0m This runs the GAP function "function(arg);" on a child process accessed by the stream s. The output from "func;" can be accessed via the stream.              | 
      | [22m[32mChildProcess()[0m [22m[32mChildProcess("workspace")[0m This starts a GAP session as a child process and returns a stream to the child process. The child GAP session can be started with any given workspace. | 
      | [22m[32mChildRead(s)[0m This returns, as a string, the output of the last application of ChildFunction("function(arg);",s).                                                                                | 
      | [22m[32mChildReadEval(s)[0m This returns, as an evaluated string, the output of the last application of ChildFunction("function(arg);",s).                                                                 |
