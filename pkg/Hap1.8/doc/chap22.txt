      | [22m[32m Add(L,x)[0m Let L be a pseudo list of length n, and x an object compatible with the entries in L. If x is not in L then this operation converts L into a pseudo list of length n+1 by adding x as the final entry. If x is in L the operation has no effect on L. | 
      | [22m[32m Append(L,K)[0m Let L be a pseudo list and K a list whose objects are compatible with those in L. This operation applies Add(L,x) for each x in K.                                                                                                                 |
