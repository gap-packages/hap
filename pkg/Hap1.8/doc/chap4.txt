      | [22m[32m LowerCentralSeriesLieAlgebra(G) [0m   [22m[32m LowerCentralSeriesLieAlgebra(f) [0m Inputs a pcp group G. If each quotient G_c/G_c+1 of the lower central series is free abelian or p-elementary abelian (for fixed prime p) then a Lie algebra L(G) is returned. The abelian group underlying L(G) is the direct sum of the quotients G_c/G_c+1 . The Lie bracket on L(G) is induced by the commutator in G. (Here G_1=G, G_c+1=[G_c,G] .) The function can also be applied to a group homomorphism f: G --> G' . In this case the induced homomorphism of Lie algebras L(f):L(G) --> L(G') is returned. If the quotients of the lower central series are not all free or p-elementary abelian then the function returns fail. This function was written by Pablo Fernandez Ascariz |
