      | [22m[32m CayleyGraphDisplay(G,X) [0m [22m[32m CayleyGraphDisplay(G,X,"mozilla") [0m Inputs a finite group G together with a subset X of G. It displays the corresponding Cayley graph as a .gif file. It uses the Mozilla web browser as a default to view the diagram. An alternative browser can be set using a second argument. The argument G can also be a finite set of elements in a (possibly infinite) group containing X. The edges of the graph are coloured according to which element of X they are labelled by. The list X corresponds to the list of colours [blue, red, green, yellow, brown, black] in that order. This function requires Graphviz software. | 
      | [22m[32m IsAspherical(F,R) [0m Inputs a free group F and a set R of words in F. It performs a test on the 2-dimensional CW-space K associated to this presentation for the group G=F/<R>^F. The function returns "true" if K has trivial second homotopy group. In this case it prints: Presentation is aspherical. Otherwise it returns "fail" and prints: Presentation is NOT piece-wise Euclidean non-positively curved. (In this case K may or may not have trivial second homotopy group. But it is NOT possible to impose a metric on K which restricts to a Euclidean metric on each 2-cell.) The function uses Polymake software.                          | 
      | [22m[32m PresentationOfResolution(R) [0m Inputs at least two terms of a reduced ZG-resolution R and returns a record P with components -- P.freeGroup is a free group F, -- P.relators is a list S of words in F, where G is isomorphic to F modulo the normal closure of S. This presentation for G corresponds to the 2-skeleton of the classifying CW-space from which R was constructed. The resolution R requires no contracting homotopy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | 
      | [22m[32m TorsionGeneratorsAbelianGroup(G) [0m Inputs an abelian group G and returns a generating set [x_1, ... ,x_n] where no pair of generators have coprime orders.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
