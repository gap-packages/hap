Inputs a ZG-resolution R, a vector u representing an element in H^p(G,Z), a vector v representing an element in H^q(G,Z) and the two integers p,q >0. It returns a vector w representing the cup product u* v in H^p+q(G,Z). This product is associative and u* v = (-1)pqv* u . It provides H^*(G,Z) with the structure of an anti-commutative graded ring. This function implements the cup product for characteristic 0 only. The resolution R needs a contracting homotopy. To save the function from having to calculate the abelian groups H^n(G,Z) additional input variables can be used in the form IntegralCupProduct(R,u,v,p,q,P,Q,N) , where -- P is the output of the command CR_CocyclesAndCoboundaries(R,p,true) -- Q is the output of the command CR_CocyclesAndCoboundaries(R,q,true) -- N is the output of the command CR_CocyclesAndCoboundaries(R,p+q,true) .                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

The second entry of the pair is a function deg which, when applied to a minimal generator, yields its degree. WARNING: the following rule must be applied when multiplying generators x_i together.

It returns the cohomology ring A=H^*(G,Z_p) modulo all elements in degree greater than n. The ring is returned as a structure constant algebra A. The ring A is graded. It has a component A!.degree(x) which is a function returning the degree of each (homogeneous) element x in GeneratorsOfAlgebra(A). An optional input variable "level" can be set to one of the strings "medium" or "high". These settings determine parameters in the algorithm. The default setting is "medium". When "level" is set to "high" the ring A is returned with a component A!.niceBasis. This component is a pair [Coeff,Bas]. Here Bas is a list of integer lists; a "nice" basis for the vector space A can be constructed using the command List(Bas,x->Product(List(x,i->Basis(A)[i])). The coefficients of the canonical basis element Basis(A)[i] are stored as Coeff[i]. If the ring A is computed using the setting "level"="medium" then the component A!.niceBasis can be added to A using the command A:=ModPCohomologyRing_part_2(A). |
