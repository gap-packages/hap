Inputs a ZG-resolution R, a vector u representing an element in H^p(G,Z), a vector v representing an element in H^q(G,Z) and the two integers p,q >0. It returns a vector w representing the cup product u* v in H^p+q(G,Z). This product is associative and u* v = (-1)pqv* u . It provides H^*(G,Z) with the structure of an anti-commutative graded ring. This function implements the cup product for characteristic 0 only. The resolution R needs a contracting homotopy. To save the function from having to calculate the abelian groups H^n(G,Z) additional input variables can be used in the form IntegralCupProduct(R,u,v,p,q,P,Q,N) , where -- P is the output of the command CR_CocyclesAndCoboundaries(R,p,true) -- Q is the output of the command CR_CocyclesAndCoboundaries(R,q,true) -- N is the output of the command CR_CocyclesAndCoboundaries(R,p+q,true) . |
