      | [22m[32m BigStepLCS(G,n) [0m Inputs a group G and a positive integer n. It returns a subseries G=L_1>L_2>... L_k=1 of the lower central series of G such that L_i/L_i+1 has order greater than n.                                                                                                                         | 
      | [22m[32m Compose(f,g) [0m Inputs two FpG-module homomorphisms f:M --> N and g:L --> M with Source(f)=Target(g) . It returns the composite homomorphism fg:L --> N . This also applies to group homomorphisms f,g.                                                                                                         |

      | [22m[32m IsLieAlgebraHomomorphism(f) [0m Inputs an object f and returns true if f is a homomorphism f:A --> B of Lie algebras (preserving the Lie bracket).                                                                                                                                                               | 
      | [22m[32m IsSuperperfect(G) [0m Inputs a group G and returns "true" if both the first and second integral homology of G is trivial. Otherwise, it returns "false".                                                                                                                                                         | 
      | [22m[32mMakeHAPManual()[0m This function creates the manual for HAP from an XML file.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | 
      | [22m[32m PermToMatrixGroup(G,n) [0m Inputs a permutation group G and its degree n. Returns a bijective homomorphism f:G --> M where M is a group of permutation matrices.                                                                                                                                                 | 
      | [22m[32m SolutionsMatDestructive(M,B) [0m Inputs an m×n matrix M and a k×n matrix B over a field. It returns a k×m matrix S satisfying SM=B. The function will leave matrix M unchanged but will probably change matrix B. (This is a trivial rewrite of the standard GAP function SolutionMatDestructive(<mat>,<vec>) .) | 
      | [22m[32m TestHap() [0m This runs a representative sample of HAP functions and checks to see that they produce the correct output.                                                                                                                                                                                         |
