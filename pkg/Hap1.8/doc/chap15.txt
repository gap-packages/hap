A small non-prime-power group G can also be input, provided the characteristic p is entered as a third input variable.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | 
      | [10X FpGModuleDualBasis(M) [0X Inputs an FpG-module M. It returns a record R with two components: -- R.freeModule is the free module FG of rank one. -- R.basis is a list representing an F-basis for the module Hom_FG(M,FG). Each term in the list is a matrix A whose rows are vectors in FG such that M!.generators[i] --> A[i] extends to a module homomorphism M --> FG.                                                                                                                                                                          |

Also inputs a list A of vectors in the vector space spanned by N!.matrix. It tests that the function M!.generators[i] --> A[i] extends to a homomorphism of FpG-modules and, if the test is passed, returns the corresponding FpG-module homomorphism. If the test is failed it returns fail. The "NC" version of the function assumes that the input defines a homomorphism and simply returns the FpG-module homomorphism. |

Alternatively, the function can input a positive integer n and at least n terms of a free resolution R of M.                                                                          |
