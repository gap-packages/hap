      | [22m[32mDesuspensionMtxModule(M)[0m Inputs a meataxe module M over the field of p elements and returns an FpG-module DM. The two modules are related mathematically by the existence of a short exact sequence DM --> FM --> M with FM a free module. Thus the homological properties of DM are equal to those of M with a dimension shift. (If G:=Group(M.generators) is a p-group then FM is a projective cover of M in the sense that the homomorphism FM --> M does not factor as FM --> P --> M for any projective module P.) | 
      | [22m[32m GeneratorsOfMtxModule(M)[0m Inputs a meataxe module M acting on, say, the vector space V. The function returns a minimal list of row vectors in V which generate V as a G-module (where G=Group(M.generators) ).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
