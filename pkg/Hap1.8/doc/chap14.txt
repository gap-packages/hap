      | [10X AddFreeWords(v,w) [0X Inputs two words v,w in a free ZG-module and returns their sum v+w. If the characteristic of Z is greater than 0 then the next function might be more efficient.                                                                                                                                    | 
      | [10X AddFreeWordsModP(v,w,p) [0X Inputs two words v,w in a free ZG-module and the characteristic p of Z. It returns the sum v+w. If p=0 the previous function might be fractionally quicker.                                                                                                                                   | 
      | [10X AlgebraicReduction(w) [0X [10X AlgebraicReduction(w,p) [0X Inputs a word w in a free ZG-module and returns a reduced version of the word in which all pairs of mutually inverse letters have been cancelled. The reduction is performed in a free abelian group unless the characteristic p of Z is entered.                     | 
      | [10X Multiply Word(n,w) [0X Inputs a word w and integer n. It returns the scalar multiple n* w.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | 
      | [10X Negate([i,j]) [0X Inputs a pair [i,j] of integers and returns [-i,j].                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | 
      | [10X NegateWord(w) [0X Inputs a word w in a free ZG-module and returns the negated word -w.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | 
      | [10X PrintZGword(w,elts) [0X Inputs a word w in a free ZG-module and a (possibly partial but sufficient) listing elts of the elements of G. The function prints the word w to the screen in the form r_1E_1 + ... + r_nE_n where r_i are elements in the group ring ZG, and E_i denotes the i-th free generator of the module. | 
      | [10X TietzeReduction(S,w) [0X Inputs a set S of words in a free ZG-module, and a word w in the module. The function returns a word w' such that {S,w'} generates the same abelian group as {S,w}. The word w' is possibly shorter (and certainly no longer) than w. This function needs to be improved!                        |
