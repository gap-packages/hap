computations can require much time and memory.&nbsp; In principle,
many of the computations can be distributed in fairly obvious ways over
several processors on a multiprocessor PC (or, using software such as
Cluster Knoppix, over several processors on a network of&nbsp; PCs).
HAP contains a few basic functions for achieving this. <br>

following commands compute the third integral homology groups of the
groups of order 32 using two child processes. This is an example of
"trivial parallelism". On a multiprocessor
machine (or Knoppix cluster) the processes would normally automatically
be assigned to different processors.<br>
