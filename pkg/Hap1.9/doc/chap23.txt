It returns the commutative diagram of vector spaces obtained by applying mod p homology. Non-prime power groups can also be handled if a prime p is entered as the third argument. Integral homology can be obtained by setting p=0. For p=0 the result is a diagram of groups. A particular resolution algorithm, such as ResolutionNilpotentGroup, can be entered as a fourth argument. For positive p the default is ResolutionPrimePowerGroup. For p=0 the default is ResolutionFiniteGroup. |
