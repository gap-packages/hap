  Inputs a ZG-resolution R, a ZG'-resolution S, and a group homomorphism f : G
  --> G'. It outputs a component object M with the following components.
  
  M!.source is the resolution R.
  M!.target is the resolution S.
  M!.mapping(w,n)  is  a  function which gives the image in S_n, under a chain
  map induced by f, of a word w in R_n. (Here R_n and S_n are the n-th modules
  in the resolutions R and S.)
  F!.properties is a list of pairs such as ["type", "equivariantChainMap"].
  
  The resolution S must have a contracting homotopy.
