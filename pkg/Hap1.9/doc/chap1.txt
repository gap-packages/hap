If one requires only a mod p resolution then the prime p can be entered as an optional third argument.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

It returns n terms of a ZG-resolution for the abelian group G=Z_L[1]+Z_L[2]+Â·Â·Â·+Z_L[d] .

Such groups can be constructed using the ACLIB package.)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

We define the relative lower central series by setting T_1=T and T_i+1=[T_i,G]. This function inputs an almost crystallographic group G together with positive integers n and c. It returns n terms of a free ZQ-resolution R for the group Q=G/T_c . In addition to the usual components, the resolution R has the component R.quotientHomomorphism which gives the quotient homomorphism G --> Q. If a fourth optional variable is set equal to "false" then the function omits to test whether Q is finite and a "more canonical" resolution is constructed.                                                                                 | 
      | [10X ResolutionArtinGroup(D,n)[0X Inputs a Coxeter diagram D and an integer n>1. It returns n terms of a free ZG-resolution R where G is the Artin monoid associated to D. It is conjectured that R is also a free resolution for the Artin group G. The conjecture is known to hold in certain cases ([7X../www/SideLinks/About/aboutArtinGroups.html[0X). G=R.group is infinite and returned as a finitely presented group. The list R.elts is a partial listing of the elements of G which grows as R is used. Initially R.elts is empty and then, any time the boundary of a resolution generator is called, R.elts is updated to include elements of G involved in the boundary. The contracting homotopy on R has not yet been implemented! Furthermore, the group G is currently returned only as a finitely presented group (without any method for solving the word problem).             |

(Asphericity can be a difficult property to verify. The function IsAspherical(F,R) could be of help.) The function returns n terms of a free ZG-resolution R which has generators in dimensions < 3 only. No contracting homotopy on R will be returned.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

It also optionally inputs a choice of vector v in the euclidean space R^n on which G acts freely. The function returns n+1 terms of the free ZG-resolution of Z arising as the cellular chain complex of the tesselation of R^n by the Dirichlet-Voronoi fundamental domain determined by v. This function is part of the HAPcryst package written by Marc Roeder and thus requires the HAPcryst package to be loaded. The function requires the use of Polymake software.                                                                                                                                                                              |

It uses GAP's standard linear algebra functions over the field F of p elements to construct a free FP-resolution for mod p calculations only. The resolution is minimal - meaning that the number of generators of R_n equals the rank of H_n(P,F). The function can also be used to obtain a free non-minimal FG-resolution of a small group G of non-prime-power order. In this case the prime p must be entered as the third input variable. (In the non-prime-power case the algorithm is naive and not very good.)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | 
      | [10X ResolutionSmallFpGroup(G,n) [0X Â  [10X ResolutionSmallFpGroup(G,n,p) [0X Inputs a small finitely presented group G and an integer n>0. It returns n terms of a ZG-resolution which, in dimensions 1 and 2, corresponds to the given presentation for G. The method returns no contracting homotopy for the resolution. The function has an optional fourth argument which, when set equal to a prime p, records the fact that the resolution will only be used for mod p calculations. This could speed up subsequent constructions. This function was written by Irina Kholodna.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | 
      | [10X ResolutionSubgroup(R,K)[0X Inputs a ZG-resolution for an (infinite) group G and a subgroup K of finite index |G:K|. It returns a free ZK-resolution whose ZK-rank is |G:K| times the ZG-rank in each dimension. If G is finite then the function ResolutionFiniteSubgroup(R,G,K) will probably work better. In particular, resolutions from this function probably won't work with the function EquivariantChainMap(). This ZK-resolution is not reduced. i.e. it has more than one generator in dimension 0.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | 
      | [10X ResolutionSubnormalSeries(L,n) [0X Inputs a positive integer n and a list L = [L_1 , ... , L_k] of subgroups L_i of a finite group G=L_1 such that L_1 > L2 ... > L_k is a subnormal series in G (meaning that each L_i+1 must be normal in L_i). It returns a ZG-resolution by repeatedly using the function ResolutionFiniteExtension(). If L is a series of normal subgroups in G then the function ResolutionNormalSeries(L,n) will possibly work more efficiently.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | 
      | [10X TwistedTensorProduct(R,S,EhomG,GmapE,NhomE,NEhomN,EltsE,Mult,InvE)[0X Inputs a ZG-resolution R, a ZN-resolution S, and other data relating to a short exact sequence 1 --> N --> E --> G --> 1. It uses a perturbation technique of CTC Wall to construct a ZE-resolution F. Both G and N could be infinite. The "length" of F is equal to the minimum of the "length"s of R and S. The resolution R needs no contracting homotopy if no such homotopy is requied for F.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
