  [10XExtendScalars(R,G,EltsG)[0m
  
  Inputs  a  ZH-resolution R, a group G containing H as a subgroup, and a list
  EltsG  of elements of G. It returns the free ZG-resolution (R otimes_ZH ZG).
  The  returned  resolution  S has S!.elts:=EltsG. This is a resolution of the
  ZG-module (Z otimes_ZH ZG). (Here otimes_ZH means tensor over ZH.)

  [10XHomToIntegers(X) [0m
  
  Inputs  either a ZG-resolution X=R, or an equivariant chain map X = (F:R -->
  S).  It  returns  the  cochain  complex  or cochain map obtained by applying
  HomZG( _ , Z) where Z is the trivial module of integers (characteristic 0).

  [10XHomToIntegersModP(R) [0m
  
  Inputs  a  ZG-resolution  R  and  returns  the  cochain  complex obtained by
  applying  HomZG( _ , Z_p) where Z_p is the trivial module of integers mod p.
  (At present this functor does not handle equivariant chain maps.)

  [10XHomToIntegralModule(R,f) [0m
  
  Inputs  a  ZG-resolution  R  and a group homomorphism f:G --> GL_n(Z) to the
  group of nÃ—n invertible integer matrices. Here Z must have characteristic 0.
  It returns the cochain complex obtained by applying HomZG( _ , A) where A is
  the  ZG-module  Z^n  with G action via f. (At present this function does not
  handle equivariant chain maps.)

  [10XTensorWithIntegralModule(R,f) [0m
  
  Inputs  a  ZG-resolution  R  and a group homomorphism f:G --> GL_n(Z) to the
  group of nÃ—n invertible integer matrices. Here Z must have characteristic 0.
  It  returns  the  chain  complex  obtained  by  tensoring  over  ZG with the
  ZG-module  A=Z^n  with  G  action  via f. (At present this function does not
  handle equivariant chain maps.)

  [10XHomToGModule(R,A) [0m
  
  Inputs  a  ZG-resolution  R  and  an abelian G-outer group A. It returns the
  G-cocomplex  obtained  by  applying HomZG( _ , A). (At present this function
  does not handle equivariant chain maps.)

  [10XInduceScalars(R,hom) [0m
  
  Inputs  a  ZQ-resolution R and a surjective group homomorphism hom:G-> Q. It
  returns the unduced non-free ZG-resolution.

  [10XLowerCentralSeriesLieAlgebra(G) [0m
  [10XLowerCentralSeriesLieAlgebra(f) [0m
  
  Inputs a pcp group G. If each quotient G_c/G_c+1 of the lower central series
  is  free  abelian  or  p-elementary  abelian  (for fixed prime p) then a Lie
  algebra  L(G)  is  returned. The abelian group underlying L(G) is the direct
  sum  of  the quotients G_c/G_c+1 . The Lie bracket on L(G) is induced by the
  commutator in G. (Here G_1=G, G_c+1=[G_c,G] .)
  
  The  function  can  also be applied to a group homomorphism f: G --> G' . In
  this  case  the  induced homomorphism of Lie algebras L(f):L(G) --> L(G') is
  returned.
  
  If  the  quotients  of  the  lower  central  series  are  not  all  free  or
  p-elementary abelian then the function returns fail.
