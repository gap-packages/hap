      | [10XHomologyPb(C,n)[0X This is a back-up function which might work in some instances where Homology(C,n) fails. It is most useful for chain complexes whose boundary homomorphisms are sparse. It inputs a chain complex C in characteristic 0 and returns the torsion coefficients of H_n(C) . There is a small probability that an incorrect answer could be returned. The computation relies on probabilistic Smith Normal Form algorithms implemented in the Simplicial Homology GAP package. This package therefore needs to be loaded. The computation is stored as a component of C so, when called a second time for a given C and n, the calculation is recalled without rerunning the algorithm. The choice of probabalistic algorithm can be changed using the command SetHomologyAlgorithm(HomologyAlgorithm[i]); where i = 1,2,3 or 4. The upper limit for the probability of an incorrect answer can be set to any rational number 0<e<= 1 using the following command. SetUncertaintyTolerence(e); See the Simplicial Homology package manual for further details.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
