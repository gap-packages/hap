  HAP  but  they  are  also  independently  included  in  Paul Smiths HAPprime
  package.)

  When  applied to a finite 2-group G this function returns a presentation for
  the  mod  2 cohomology ring H^*(G,Z_2). The Lyndon-Hochschild-Serre spectral
  sequence is used to prove that the presentation is correct.
  
  When  the  function  is  applied  to  a 2-group G and positive integer n the
  function  first  constructs  n  terms  of  a  free  Z_2G-resolution  R, then
  constructs  the  finite-dimensional  graded  algebra A=H^(*le n)(G,Z_2), and
  finally   uses   A   to  approximate  a  presentation  for  H^*(G,Z_2).  For
  "sufficiently  large"  the  approximation will be a correct presentation for
  H^*(G,Z_2).
  
  Alternatively, the function can be applied directly to either the resolution
  R or graded algebra A.
  
  This  function  was  written by [12XPaul Smith[0m. It uses the Singular commutative
  algebra package to handle the Lyndon-Hochschild-Serre spectral sequence.

  Inputs   a   finite   2-group  G  and  returns  a  quotient  of  polynomials
  f(x)=P(x)/Q(x)  whose coefficient of x^k equals the rank of the vector space
  H_k(G,Z_2) for all k.
  
  This  function  was  written  by  [12XPaul Smith[0m. It use the Singular system for
