If no argument is given then the child process is created on the local machine; otherwise the argument should be: 1) the address of a remote computer for which ssh has been configured to require no password from the user; (2) or a list of GAP command line options; (3) or the address of a computer followed by a list of command line options. (To configure ssh so that the user can login without a password prompt from "thishost" to "remotehost" either consult "man ssh" or - open a shell on thishost - cd .ssh - ls -> if id_dsa, id_rsa etc exists, skip the next two steps! - ssh-keygen -t rsa - ssh-keygen -t dsa - scp *.pub user@remotehost:~/ - ssh remotehost -l user - cat id_rsa.pub >> .ssh/authorized_keys - cat id_dsa.pub >> .ssh/authorized_keys - rm id_rsa.pub id_dsa.pub - exit You should now be able to connect from "thishost" to "remotehost" without a password prompt.) |
