      | [10XRipsChainComplex(S,epsilon)[0X [10XRipsChainComplex(S,epsilon,true)[0X Inputs an n x n symmetric matrix S with non-negative rational entries, together with a positive rational number epsilon. The matrix is interpreted as that arising from a set of n points in a metric space, the (i,j) entry representing the distance between the i-th and j-th points. (However, for the construction to work, there is no need for S to actually arise in this way.) The function constructs the simplicial complex X with n vertices and with one k-simplex for each subset of k points where any two elements in the subset are within a distance epsilon of each other. The function then returns the low dimensions of a chain complex C which is homotopy equivalent to the cellular chain complex C(X). With any luck C will be smaller than C(X). At present the function only returns C up to and including dimension 2. So it can be used to compute the first homology of X. If an optional third argument is set equal to true then the function returns a list of chain complexes whose direct sum is homotopy equivalent to C(X) in low dimensions. This option can be used to calculate the homology of C more efficiently. |

Optionally, a function distance(v,w) can be entered as a second argument. This function has to return a rational number for each pair of rational vectors v,w of length Length(M[1]).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
