homology groups H<sub>n</sub>(X,Z) of a space are reasonably
straighforward invariants to
compute.&nbsp; Its homotopy groups Pi<sub>n</sub>(X) are, by contrast,
extremely
difficult to compute and the difficulty
increases with n.&nbsp; For instance, the
homotopy groups of one of
the most basic spaces, the 2-dimensional sphere S<sup>2</sup>, are
still only known
for relatively small n. <br>
      <br>
When homotopy groups were introduced back in the 1930s they were at
first believed to be isomorphic to the homology groups. Heinz
Hopf's surprising discovery that Pi<sub>3</sub>(S<sup>2</sup>) = Z soon
put pay to that belief. <br>
&nbsp;<br>
The sphere can be regarded as a suspension S<sup>2</sup>=SK(Z,1) of an
Eilenberg-Mac Lane space K(Z,1) for the infinite cyclic group Z. There
has recently been some interest in computing the third homotopy group Pi<sub>3</sub>(SK(G,1))
of the suspension of Eilenberg-Mac Lane spaces for other groups G. (The
Hurewicz Theorem shows that Pi<sub>2</sub>(G)=G<sub>ab</sub> and Pi<sub>1</sub>(G)=0.)<br>
      <br>
A purely group theoretic description of Pi<sub>3</sub>(SK(G,1)) was
found in [R. Brown &amp; J.-L. Loday, "van Kampen theorems diagrams for
diagrams of spaces", <span style="font-style: italic;">Topology</span>
1987]. They described it as a kernel of a
group homomorphism<br>

where G(&times;)G denotes a certain "nonabelian tensor square" of the
group G. The following command uses this isomorphism to compute Pi<sub>3</sub>(SK(G,1))
