<Verb>RestrictedEquivariantCWComplex(Y,H):: RegCWComplex, Group --> EquivariantRegCWComplex</Verb><P/>

<P/> Inputs  a <M>G</M>-equivariant regular CW-space Y and a subgroup <M>H \le G</M> for which GAP can find a transversal. It returns the equivariant regular CW-complex obtained by retricting the action to <M>H</M>.
