<h3>Download Instructions</h3>
<p>
On a Linux machine with GAP installed, the HAP library can be loaded as
follows:<br>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>First download the file <a
 href="http://hamilton.nuigalway.ie/Hap/hap1.15.tar.gz">hap1.15.tar.gz</a>
which contains the most recent development version of HAP to the
subdirectory
"pkg/" of GAP. If you don't have access to this subdirectory,
then create a directory "pkg" in your home directory and download the
file there. (if for some reason you'd prefer to download the most
recent non-development version of HAP then download the file&nbsp; <a
 href="http://hamilton.nuigalway.ie/Hap/hap1.15.tar.gz">hap1.15.tar.gz</a>
instead.)<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Change to directory "pkg/" and type "gunzip
hap1.15.tar.gz"
followed
by "tar
-xvf hap1.15.tar" .</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Start GAP. (If you have created "pkg" in your home
directory then
start GAP with the command "gap -l 'path/homedir;' " &nbsp; where
path/homedir is the path to your home directory.)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>In GAP type " LoadPackage("HAP"); "<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Help on HAP can be found on the <a
 href="http://hamilton.nuigalway.ie/Hap/www/index.html" target="index">HAP
home page</a> (a version of which is included in directory
"pkg/Hap1.15/www" of the distribution).</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>A few of HAP's (optional) functions rely on Polymake
software
(available from www.math.tu-berlin.de/polymake/) which should be
installed so that it
starts using the command "polymake" at the Linux prompt. A few
(optional) functions rely on Graphviz software (available from
http://www.graphviz.org/).<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Performance can be improved by using a compiled
version of the HAP library. The following steps will produce a compiled
version. <br>
(1) Change to the directory "pkg/Hap1.15/" .<br>
(2) Edit the file "compile" so that: PKGDIR is equal to the path to the<br>
directory "pkg" where your GAP packages are stored; GACDIR is equal to
the<br>
path to the directory where the GAP compiler "gac" is stored.<br>
(3) Type "./compile" .<br>
The next time HAP is loaded a compiled version will be loaded.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Should you want to return to an uncompiled version, change
to the directory<br>
"pkg/Hap1.15/" and type "./uncompile".</li>
</ul>
