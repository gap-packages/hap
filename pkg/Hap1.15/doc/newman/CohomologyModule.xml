<Verb>CohomologyModule(C,n):: GCocomplex, Int --> GOuterGroup</Verb><P/>

<P/> 
Inputs a <M>G</M>-cocomplex <M>C</M> together with a non-negative integer 
<M>n</M>. It returns the cohomology <M>H^n(C)</M> as a <M>G</M>-outer group. 
If <M>C</M> was constructed from a <M>\mathbb ZG</M>-resolution 
<M>R</M> by homing to an abelian <M>G</M>-outer group <M>A</M> then, for each 
<M>x</M> in <M>H:=CohomologyModule(C,n)</M>, there is a function 
<M>f:=H!.representativeCocycle(x)</M> which is a standard <M>n</M>-cocycle 
corresponding to the cohomology class <M>x</M>. (At present this is implemented
 only for 
<M>n=1,2,3</M>.)
