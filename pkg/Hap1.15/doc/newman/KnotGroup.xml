<Verb>KnotGroup(K):: PureCubicalComplex --> FpGroup</Verb><P/>

<P/> Inputs a pure cubical or pure permutahedral complex <M>K</M> 
and returns the fundamental group of its complement. If the complement is path-connected then this fundamental group is unique up to isomorphism. Otherwise it will depend on the path-component in which the randomly chosen base-point lies.
