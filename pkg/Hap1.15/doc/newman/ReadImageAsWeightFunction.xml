<Verb>ReadImageAsWeightFunction(str,t):: String, Int --> RegCWComplex, Function</Verb><P/>


<P/>
Reads an image file identified by a string str such as
"file.bmp", "file.eps", "file.jpg", "path/file.png" etc.,  
together with an integer <M>t</M>.
It constructs a <M>2</M>-dimensional
  regular CW-complex <M>Y</M>  from the image, together with a 
weight function <M>w\colon Y\rightarrow \mathbb Z</M> corresponding to a 
filtration on <M>Y</M> of filtration length <M>t</M>. The pair <M>[Y,w]</M>
is returned.
