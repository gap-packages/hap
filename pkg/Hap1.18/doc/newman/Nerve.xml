<Verb>Nerve(M,n):: PurePermComplex, Int --> SimplicialComplex</Verb><P/>

<P/>Inputs a pure cubical complex or pure permutahedral complex <M>M</M> and
  returns the simplicial complex <M>K</M> obtained by taking the nerve of an
  open cover of <M>|M|</M>, the open sets in the cover being sufficiently small
  neighbourhoods of the top-dimensional cells of <M>|M|</M>. The spaces <M>|M|</M> and
  <M>|K|</M> are homotopy equivalent by the Nerve Theorem.
  If an integer <M>n \ge 0</M> is supplied as the second argument then only the
  n-skeleton of <M>K</M> is returned.
