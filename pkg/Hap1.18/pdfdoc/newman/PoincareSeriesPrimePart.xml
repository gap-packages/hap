<Verb>PoincareSeriesPrimePart(G,p,n):: Group, Int, Int --> RationalFunction</Verb><P/>


<P/> 
Inputs a finite group <M>G</M>, a prime <M>p</M>, and a positive integer <M>n</M>. It returns a quotient of polynomials <M>f(x)=P(x)/Q(x)</M>
 whose expansion has coefficient of <M>x^k</M> equal to
 the rank of the vector space <M>H_k(G,\mathbb F_p)</M> for all <M>k</M>
 in the range <M>1\le k\le n</M>. 

(The efficiency of this function could be improved.)
