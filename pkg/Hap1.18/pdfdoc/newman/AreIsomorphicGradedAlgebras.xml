<Verb>AreIsomorphicGradedAlgebras(A,B):: PresentedGradedAlgebra, PresentedGradedAlgebra --> Boolean</Verb><P/>



Inputs two freely presented graded algebras
 <M>A=\mathbb F[x_1, \ldots, x_m]/I</M> and
<M>B=\mathbb F[y_1, \ldots, y_n]/J</M> and returns <B>true</B> if they are isomorphic, and <B>false</B> otherwise.
