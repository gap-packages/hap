<Verb>HilbertPoincareSeries::PresentedGradedAlgebra  --> RationalFunction</Verb>

Inputs a presentation <M>E=\mathbb F[x_1,\ldots,x_m]/I</M> of a  graded algebra 
 and returns its Hilbert-Poincar\'e series. 

This function was written by Paul Smith and  uses the Singular commutative algebra package. It is essentially a wrapper for Singular's Hilbert-Poincare series.
