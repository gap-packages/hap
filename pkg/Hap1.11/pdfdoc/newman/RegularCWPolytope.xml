<Verb>RegularCWPolytope(G,v):: PermGroup, List --> RegCWComplex</Verb><P/>

<P/> Inputs a list <M>L</M> of vectors in <M>\mathbb R^n</M> and outputs their
 convex hull as a regular CW-complex.

<P/> Inputs a permutation group G of degree <M>d</M> and vector <M>v\in \mathbb R^d</M>, 
and outputs the convex hull of the orbit <M>\{v^g : g\in G\}</M> as a regular CW-complex.
