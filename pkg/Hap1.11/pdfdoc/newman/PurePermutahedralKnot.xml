<Verb>PurePermutahedralKnot(n,k):: Int, Int --> PurePermutahedralComplex</Verb>
<Verb>PurePermutahedralKnot(L):: List --> PurePermutahedralComplex</Verb>




<P/> Inputs integers <M>n, k</M> and returns the <M>k</M>-th prime knot on <M>n</M> crossings as a pure permutahedral complex (if this prime knot exists). 

<P/> Inputs a list <M>L</M> describing an arc presentation for a knot or link
and returns the knot or link as a pure permutahedral complex.
