<Verb>OrbitPolytope(G,v,L) :: PermGroup, List, List --> void</Verb><P/>

<P/>Inputs a permutation group or finite matrix group <M>G</M> of degree <M>d</M>
and a rational vector <M>v\in \mathbb R^d</M>.
In both cases there is a natural action of <M>G</M> on <M>\mathbb R^d</M>.
Let <M>P(G,v)</M> be the convex hull 
of the orbit of <M>v</M> under the action of
<M>G</M>. The function also inputs a sublist <M>L</M> of the
following list of strings: 
["dimension","vertex\_degree", "visual\_graph", "schlegel", "visual"] 

<P/>Depending on <M>L</M>, the function displays the following information:\\ 
the dimension of the orbit polytope <M>P(G,v)</M>;\\ 
the degree of a vertex in the graph of <M>P(G,v)</M>;\\ 
a visualization of the graph of <M>P(G,v)</M>;\\ 
a visualization of the Schlegel diagram of <M>P(G,v)</M>;\\ 
a visualization of the polytope <M>P(G,v)</M> if <M>d=2,3</M>.

<P/>The function requires Polymake software.
