<Verb>EquivariantOrbitPolytope(G,v):: PermGroup, List --> EquivariantRegCWComplex</Verb><P/>

<P/> Inputs a permutation group <M>G</M> of degree <M>n</M>  together with a row vector <M>v \in \mathbb R^n</M>. It returns, as an equivariant regular CW-space, the convex hull of the orbit of <M>v</M>   
 under the canonical left action of <M>G</M> on <M>\mathbb R^n</M>.
