<P/> Inputs a chain complex <M>C</M> and integer <M>n \ge 0</M> and returns
the <M>n</M>-th homology group of <M>C</M> as a list of its abelian invariants. 

<P/> Inputs a chain map <M>F</M> and integer <M>n \ge 0</M>. It returns the 
induced  homology homomorphism <M>H_n(F)</M> as a homomorphism of finitely presented groups.

<P/> Inputs a cubical, or pure cubical, or pure permutahedral or regular CW or
simplicial 
 complex <M>K</M>  together with an integer <M>n \ge 0</M>. It returns the 
<M>n</M>-th integral homology group of <M>K</M> as a list of its abelian invariants.
