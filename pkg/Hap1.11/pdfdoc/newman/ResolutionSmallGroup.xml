<Verb>ResolutionSmallGroup(G,k):: Group, Int --> FreeResolution</Verb>
<Verb>ResolutionSmallGroup(G,k):: FpGroup, Int --> FreeResolution</Verb>


<P/> 
Inputs a small group <M>G</M> 
and  an integer <M>k \ge 1</M>. 
It 
returns   <M>k+1</M> terms of a free ZG-resolution 
of <M>\mathbb Z</M>.

<P/> If <M>G</M> is a finitely presented group then up to degree $2$ the resolution coincides with cellular chain complex of the universal cover of the <M>2</M> complex associated to the presentation of <M>G</M>. Thus the boundaries of
the generators in degree <M>3</M> provide a generating set for the module of identities of the presentation.

<P/>
