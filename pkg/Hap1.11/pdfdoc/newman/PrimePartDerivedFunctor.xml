<Verb>PrimePartDerivedFunctor(G,R,A,k):: Group, FreeResolution, Function, Int --> List</Verb><P/>

<P/> Inputs a group <M>G</M>, an integer <M>k \ge 0</M>, at least <M>k+1</M> terms of a free <M>\mathbb ZP</M>-resolution of <M>\mathbb Z</M> for <M>P</M> a Sylow <M>p</M>-subgroup of <M>G</M>. A function such as <B>A=TensorWithIntegers</B> is also entered.  The abelian invariants of the <M>p</M>-primary part <M>H_k(G,A)_{(p)}</M> of the homology with coefficients in <M>A</M> is returned.
