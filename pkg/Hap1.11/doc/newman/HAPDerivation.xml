<Verb>HAPDerivation(R,I,L):: PolynomialRing, List, List --> Derivation</Verb><P/>

Inputs a polynomial ring <M>R=\mathbb F[x_1,\ldots,x_m]</M> over a field 
<M>\mathbb F</M> together with a list <M>I</M> of generators for an ideal in 
<M>R</M> and a list <M>L=[y_1,\ldots,y_m]\subset R</M>. It returns the 
derivation
 <M>d\colon E \rightarrow E</M> for <M>E=R/I</M> defined by 
<M>d(x_i)=y_i</M>.

This function was written by Paul Smith. It uses the Singular commutative algebra package.
