<Verb>ReadImageAsFilteredPureCubicalComplex(str,n):: String, Int --> FilteredPureCubicalComplex</Verb><P/>


<P/>
Reads an image file identified by a string str such as
"file.bmp", "file.eps", "file.jpg", "path/file.png" etc.,  
together with a positive integer <M>n</M>.
It returns a <M>2</M>-dimensional filtered pure cubical complex of filtration length <M>n</M>. The <M>k</M>th
term in the filtration is a pure cubical complex  
corresponding to a  
 black/white version of the image determined by the threshold <M>t_k=k \times 765/n </M>. 
The <M>2</M>-cells of the  <M>k</M>th
term 
correspond to pixels with RGB value <M>R+G+B \le t_k</M>.
