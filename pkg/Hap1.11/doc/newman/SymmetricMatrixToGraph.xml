<Verb>SymmetricMatrixToGraph(A,t):: Mat, Rat --> Graph</Verb><P/>

<P/> Inputs an <M>n\times n</M> symmetric matrix <M>A</M> over the rationals
 and a rational number <M>t \ge 0</M>, 
and returns the graph on the vertices <M>1,2, \ldots, n</M>
 with an edge between distinct vertices
<M>i</M> and <M>j</M> precisely when the <M>(i,j)</M> entry of <M>A</M>
is <M>\le t</M>.
