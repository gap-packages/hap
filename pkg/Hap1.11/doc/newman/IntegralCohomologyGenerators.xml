<Verb>IntegralCohomologyGenerators(R,n):: FreeResolution, Int --> List</Verb><P/>



Inputs at least <M>n+1</M> terms of a free <M>\mathbb ZG</M>-resolution of
<M>\mathbb Z</M> and the  integer <M> n \ge 1</M>. It returns a minimal list of 
cohomology classes in <M>H^n(G,\mathbb Z)</M> which, together with all cup 
products of lower degree classes, generate the group <M>H^n(G,\mathbb Z)</M> .

(Let <M>a_i</M> be the <M>i</M>-th canonical generator of the <M>d</M>-generator abelian group <M>H^n(G,Z)</M>. The cohomology class <M>n_1a_1 + ... +n_da_d</M> is represented by the integer vector <M>u=(n_1, ..., n_d)</M>. )
