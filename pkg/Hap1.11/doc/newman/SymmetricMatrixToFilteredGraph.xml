<Verb>SymmetricMatrixToFilteredGraph(A,m,s):: Mat, Int, Rat --> FilteredGraph</Verb>
<Verb>SymmetricMatrixToFilteredGraph(A,m):: Mat, Int --> FilteredGraph</Verb><P/>

<P/>Inputs an <M>n \times n</M>
  symmetric matrix <M>A</M>, a positive integer <M>m</M>  and a
 positive rational <M>s</M>. 
The function returns a filtered graph of filtration 
length <M>m</M>. The <M>t</M>-th term of the filtration is a graph with 
<M>n</M>
vertices  
and
 an edge  between the <M>i</M>-th and <M>j</M>-th vertices if the  
<M>(i,j)</M> entry of <M>A</M> is less than or equal to <M>t \times s/m</M>. 

<P/> If the optional input <M>s</M> is omitted then it is set equal to the largest entry in the matrix <M>A</M>.
