This subdirectory Hap/1.11/lib/HapCocyclic/ contain the files of 
the HAPcocyclic package written by Robert F. Morse. 

The files init.g and read.g have been slightly modified so that 
they can be read when loading the HAP package. However, these two
HAPcocyclic files will only be read if the HAPcocyclic package is 
not present in the GAP/pkg directory.

The file Ccgroup.gi has been slightly modified to obatin correct 
results on extensions N >-->E -->> G for which N is not abelian.
