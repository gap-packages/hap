On a Linux machine with GAP installed, the HAP library can be loaded as
follows:<br>
      <ul>
        <li>First download the file <a style="color: rgb(0, 0, 102);"
 href="../../../hap1.5.tar.gz"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">hap1.5.tar.gz</span></a>
to the subdirectory "pkg/" of GAP. (If you don't have access to this,
then create a directory "pkg" in your home directory and download the
file there.)</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>Change to directory "pkg/" and type "gunzip hap1.5.tar.gz"
followed
by "tar
-xvf hap1.5.tar" .</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>Start GAP. (If you have created "pkg" in your home
directory then
start GAP with the command "gap -l 'path/homedir;' " &nbsp; where
path/homedir is the path to your home directory.)</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>In GAP type " LoadPackage("HAP"); "<br>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>Help on HAP can be found on the <a
 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 102);" href="../../index.html" target="index">HAP
home page</a> (a version of which is included in directory
"pkg/Hap1.5/www" of the distribution).</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>A few of HAP's (optional) functions rely on Polymake
software
(available from www.math.tu-berlin.de/polymake/) which should be
installed so that it
starts using the command "polymake" at the Linux prompt.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>Performance can be improved by using a compiled
version of the HAP library. The following steps will produce a compiled
version. <br>
(1) Change to the directory "pkg/Hap1.5/" .<br>
(2) Edit the file "compile" so that: PKGDIR is equal to the path to the<br>
directory "pkg" where your GAP packages are stored; GACDIR is equal to
the<br>
path to the directory where the GAP compiler "gac" is stored.<br>
(3) Type "./compile" .<br>
The next time HAP is loaded a compiled version will be loaded.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>Should you want to return to an uncompiled version, change
to the directory<br>
"pkg/Hap1.5/" and type "./uncompile".</li>
      </ul>

Version <a href="../../../hap1.4.tar.gz">1.4</a> was released on
03/05/2006.<br>
      <br>
Version <a href="../../../hap1.5.tar.gz">1.5</a> was released on
12/06/2006. GAP types were introduced for resolutions, chain complexes
etc. and methods for PrintObj and ViewObj were introduced.&nbsp; The
functions Homology and Cohomology where changed to GAP operations. A
Linux shell script "compile" for creating a GAC compiled version of the
HAP functions was added. The performance of the functions
NonabelianTensorSquare() and ResolutionPrimePowerGroup() was improved.
Functions&nbsp; ResolutionSubnormalSeries(),
ResolutionAlmostCrystalGroup() and ResolutionAlmostCrystalQuotient()
were added.<br>
